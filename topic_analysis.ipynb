       "['Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people’s daily lives and has caused economic loss worldwide. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the pandemic has increased depression levels among the population. However, systematic studies of depression detection and monitoring during the pandemic are lacking. Objective This study aims to develop a method to create a large-scale depression user data set in an automatic fashion so that the method is scalable and can be adapted to future events; verify the effectiveness of transformer-based deep learning language models in identifying depression users from their everyday language; examine psychological text features’ importance when used in depression classification; and, finally, use the model for monitoring the fluctuation of depression levels of different groups as the disease propagates. Methods To study this subject, we designed an effective regular expression-based search method and created the largest English Twitter depression data set containing 2575 distinct identified users with depression and their past tweets. To examine the effect of depression on people’s Twitter language, we trained three transformer-based depression classification models on the data set, evaluated their performance with progressively increased training sizes, and compared the model’s tweet chunk-level and user-level performances. Furthermore, inspired by psychological studies, we created a fusion classifier that combines deep learning model scores with psychological text features and users’ demographic information, and investigated these …',\n",

       " 'The coronavirus outbreak has brought unprecedented measures, which forced the authorities to make decisions related to the instauration of lockdowns in the areas most hit by the pandemic. Social media has been an important support for people while passing through this difficult period. On November 9, 2020, when the first vaccine with more than 90% effective rate has been announced, the social media has reacted and people worldwide have started to express their feelings related to the vaccination, which was no longer a hypothesis but closer, each day, to become a reality. The present paper aims to analyze the dynamics of the opinions regarding COVID-19 vaccination by considering the one-month period following the first vaccine announcement, until the first vaccination took place in UK, in which the civil society has manifested a higher interest regarding the vaccination process. Classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been compared to select the best performing classifier. 2 349 659 tweets have been collected, analyzed, and put in connection with the events reported by the media. Based on the analysis, it can be observed that most of the tweets have aneutralstance, while the number ofin favortweets overpasses the number ofagainsttweets. As for the news, it has been observed that the occurrence of tweets follows the trend of the events. Even more, the proposed approach can be used for a longer monitoring campaign that can help the governments to create appropriate means of communication and to evaluate them in order to provide clear and adequate information to the general public, which could increase the public trust in a vaccination campaign.',\n",
       " 'On 11 March 2020, the (WHO) World Health Organization declared COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Disease 2019) as a pandemic. A further crisis has manifested mass fear and panic, driven by lack of information, or sometimes outright misinformation, alongside the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter is one of the prominent and trusted social media in this current outbreak. Over time, boundless COVID-19 headlines and vast awareness have been spreading, with tweets, updates, videos, and explosive posts. Few studies have been performed on the pandemic to detect and interrelate various disease types, including current coronavirus. However, it is pretty tricky to discriminate and detect a specific category. This work is motivated by the need to inform society about limiting irrelevant information and avoiding spreading negative emotions. In this context, the current work focuses on informative tweet detection in the pandemic to provide relevant information to the government, medical organizations, victims services, etc. This paper used a Majority Voting technique-based Ensemble Deep Learning (MVEDL) model. This MVEDL model is used to identify COVID-19 related (INFORMATIVE) tweets. The state-of-art deep learning models RoBERTa, BERTweet, and CT-BERT are used for best performance with the MVEDL model. The “COVID-19 English labeled tweets” dataset is used for training and testing the MVEDL model. The MVEDL model has shown 91.75 percent accuracy, 91.14 percent F1-score and outperforms the traditional machine learning and deep learning models. We also investigate how to use the MVEDL model for sentiment analysis on 226668 unlabeled COVID-19 tweets and their informative tweets. The application section discussed a comprehensive analysis of both actual and informative tweets. According to our knowledge, this is the first work on COVID-19 sentiment analysis using a deep learning ensemble model.',\n",
       " \"In this pioneering study, inspired by AutoGPT, the state-of-the-art open-source application based on the GPT-4 large language model, we develop a novel tool called AD-AutoGPT which can conduct data collection, processing, and analysis about complex health narratives of Alzheimer's Disease in an autonomous manner via users' textual prompts. We collated comprehensive data from a variety of news sources, including the Alzheimer's Association, BBC, Mayo Clinic, and the National Institute on Aging since June 2022, leading to the autonomous execution of robust trend analyses, intertopic distance maps visualization, and identification of salient terms pertinent to Alzheimer's Disease. This approach has yielded not only a quantifiable metric of relevant discourse but also valuable insights into public focus on Alzheimer's Disease. This application of AD-AutoGPT in public health signifies the transformative potential of AI in facilitating a data-rich understanding of complex health narratives like Alzheimer's Disease in an autonomous manner, setting the groundwork for future AI-driven investigations in global health landscapes.\",\n",
       " 'With Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating various aspects of society, including healthcare, the adoption of the Transformers neural network architecture is rapidly changing many applications. Transformer is a type of deep learning architecture initially developed to solve general-purpose Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and has subsequently been adapted in many fields, including healthcare. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of how this architecture has been adopted to analyze various forms of data, including medical imaging, structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, physiological signals, and biomolecular sequences. Those models could help in clinical diagnosis, report generation, data reconstruction, and drug/protein synthesis. We identified relevant studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of using transformers in healthcare and examine issues such as computational cost, model interpretability, fairness, alignment with human values, ethical implications, and environmental impact.',\n",
       " 'Depression has become one of the most widespread mental health disorders across the globe. Depression is a state of mind which affects how we think, feel, and act. The number of suicides caused by depression has been on the rise for the last several years. This issue needs to be addressed. Considering the rapid growth of various social media platforms and their effect on society and the psychological context of a being, it’s becoming a platform for depressed people to convey feelings and emotions, and to study their behavior by mining their social activity through social media posts. The key objective of our study is to explore the possibility of predicting a user’s mental condition by classifying the depressive from non-depressive ones using Twitter data. Using textual content of the user’s tweet, semantic context in the textual narratives is analyzed by utilizing deep learning models. The proposed model, however, is a hybrid of two deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (biLSTM) that after optimization obtains an accuracy of 94.28% on benchmark depression dataset containing tweets. CNN-biLSTM model is compared with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and CNN model and also with the baseline approaches. Experimental results based on various performance metrics indicate that our model helps to improve predictive performance. To examine the problem more deeply, statistical techniques and visualization approaches were used to show the profound difference between the linguistic representation of depressive and non-depressive content.',\n",
       " 'Online social media provides a channel for monitoring people’s social behaviors from which to infer and detect their mental distresses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, online social networks were increasingly used to express opinions, views, and moods due to the restrictions on physical activities and in-person meetings, leading to a significant amount of diverse user-generated social media content. This offers a unique opportunity to examine how COVID-19 changed global behaviors regarding its ramifications on mental well-being. In this article, we surveyed the literature on social media analysis for the detection of mental distress, with a special emphasis on the studies published since the COVID-19 outbreak. We analyze relevant research and its characteristics and propose new approaches to organizing the large amount of studies arising from this emerging research area, thus drawing new views, insights, and knowledge for interested communities. Specifically, we first classify the studies in terms of feature extraction types, language usage patterns, aesthetic preferences, and online behaviors. We then explored various methods (including machine learning and deep learning techniques) for detecting mental health problems. Building upon the in-depth review, we present our findings and discuss future research directions and niche areas in detecting mental health problems using social media data. We also elaborate on the challenges of this fast-growing research area, such as technical issues in deploying such systems at scale as well as privacy and ethical concerns.',\n",

       " '#StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate are two of the most commonly used hashtags that represent the current movement to end hate crimes against the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. We conduct a social media study of public opinion toward the #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate movement based on 46 058 Twitter users across 30 states in USA ranging from March 18, 2021 to April 11, 2021. To facilitate fine-grained analyses, the demographic information of the Twitter users, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, social capital, political affiliation, geolocation, family, income, and religious status, is either retrieved from the user profiles or inferred using classifiers. We find that the movement attracts more participation from women, younger adults, Asian, and Black communities. It is noteworthy that most of them are also active in other online movements related to racial or social issues, such as #BlackLivesMatter or #SayHerName; 51.56% of the Twitter users show direct support, 18.38% are news about anti-Asian hate crimes, and 5.43% show a negative attitude toward the movement. By conducting logistic regression, we find that the public opinion varies across user characteristics. Furthermore, among the states with most racial bias-motivated hate crimes, the negative attitude toward the #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate movement is the weakest. The majority of the top influencers are Asian–American reporters, journalists, or politicians. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to understand public opinion toward the #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate movement. We hope that our study can provide insights and promote research on anti-Asian hate crimes and ultimately help address such a serious societal issue for the common benefits of all communities.',\n",

       " 'As mental health (MH) disorders become increasingly prevalent, their multifaceted symptoms and comorbidities with other conditions introduce complexity to diagnosis, posing a risk of underdiagnosis. While machine learning (ML) has been explored to mitigate these challenges, we hypothesized that multiple data modalities support more comprehensive detection and that non-intrusive collection approaches better capture natural behaviors. To understand the current trends, we systematically reviewed 184 studies to assess feature extraction, feature fusion, and ML methodologies applied to detect MH disorders from passively sensed multimodal data, including audio and video recordings, social media, smartphones, and wearable devices. Our findings revealed varying correlations of modality-specific features in individualized contexts, potentially influenced by demographics and personalities. We also observed the growing adoption of neural network architectures for model-level fusion and as ML algorithms, which have demonstrated promising efficacy in handling high-dimensional features while modeling within and cross-modality relationships. This work provides future researchers with a clear taxonomy of methodological approaches to multimodal detection of MH disorders to inspire future methodological advancements. The comprehensive analysis also guides and supports future researchers in making informed decisions to select an optimal data source that aligns with specific use cases based on the MH disorder of interest.',\n",
       " 'Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) presents considerable challenges to diagnosis and management due to symptom variability across time. Only recent work has highlighted the clinical implications for interrogating depression symptom variability. Thus, the present work investigates how sociodemographic, comorbidity, movement, and sleep data is associated with long-term depression symptom variability. Participant information included (N=\\u2009939) baseline sociodemographic and comorbidity data, longitudinal, passively collected wearable data, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores collected over 12 months. An ensemble machine learning approach was used to detect long-term depression symptom variability via: (i) a domain-driven feature selection approach and (ii) an exhaustive feature-inclusion approach. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to interrogate variable importance and directionality. The composite domain-driven and exhaustive inclusion models were both capable of moderately detecting long-term depression symptom variability (r=\\u20090.33 andr=\\u20090.39, respectively). Our results indicate the incremental predictive validity of sociodemographic, comorbidity, and passively collected wearable movement and sleep data in detecting long-term depression symptom variability.',\n",
       " 'The COVID-19 infection, which began in December 2019, has claimed many lives and impacted all aspects of human life. With time, COVID-19 was identified as a pandemic outbreak by the World Health Organization (WHO), putting massive pressure on global health. During this ongoing pandemic, the exponential growth of social media platforms has provided valuable resources for distributing information, as well as a source for self-reported disease symptoms in public discourse. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective approaches to detect self-reported symptoms or cases in social media content. In this study, we scrapped public discourse on COVID-19 symptoms in Twitter content. For this, we developed a huge dataset of COVID-19 self-reported symptoms and gold-annotated the tweets into four categories: confirmed, death, suspected, and recovered. Then, we use a machine and deep machine learning models, each with its own set of features, such as feature representation. Furthermore, the experimentations were achieved with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) variants and compared their performance with traditional machine learning algorithms. Experimental results report that optimizing the area under the curve (AUC) enhances model performance, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) has the highest accuracy in detecting COVID-19 symptoms in real-time public messaging. Thus, the LSTM classifier in the proposed pipeline achieves a classification accuracy of 90.7%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-class classification.',\n",
       " 'This study examines the influence of social media on learning and education inside higher education institutions in Saudi Arabia. This study attempts to utilize the e-learning acceptance model (e-LAM) in order to identify some of the variables that impact Saudi students’ inclination to utilize social media for educational purposes at higher learning institutions in Saudi Arabia. The e-LAM draws on a number of different theoretical viewpoints in order to present a more comprehensive picture of the variables that encourage the use of social media in learning and education in Saudi Arabian higher education institutions while students are enrolled in universities. The study’s survey was completed by 369 undergraduates’ participants enrolled in various academic programs and different educational levels. With the use of structural equation modeling, the analysis was carried out in order to investigate the correlations that existed between the variables that were stated in the conceptual model. Social media adoption intentions in Saudi Arabian higher education institutions were found to be significantly related to performance and self, supporting hypotheses 3 and 4, while communication functionality (COM) and effort (E) were found to be not significant towards Saudi Arabian students’ intentions to adopt social media, thus rejecting hypotheses 1 and 2.',\n",
       " 'It has been more than a year since the coronavirus (COVID-19) engulfed the whole world, disturbing the daily routine, bringing down the economies, and killing two million people across the globe at the time of writing. The pandemic brought the world together to a joint effort to find a cure and work toward developing a vaccine. Much to the anticipation, the first batch of vaccines started rolling out by the end of 2020, and many countries began the vaccination drive early on while others still waiting in anticipation for a successful trial. Social media, meanwhile, was bombarded with all sorts of both positive and negative stories of the development and the evolving coronavirus situation. Many people were looking forward to the vaccines, while others were cautious about the side-effects and the conspiracy theories resulting in mixed emotions. This study explores users’ tweets concerning the COVID-19 vaccine and the sentiments expressed on Twitter. It tries to evaluate the polarity trend and a shift since the start of the coronavirus to the vaccination drive across six countries. The findings suggest that people of neighboring countries have shown quite a similar attitude regarding the vaccination in contrast to their different reactions to the coronavirus outbreak.',\n",
       " 'The COVID-19 pandemic has been repeatedly associated with poor mental health. Previous studies have mostly focused on short time frames such as around the first lockdown periods, and the majority of research is based on self-report questionnaires. Less is known about the fluctuations of psychological states over longer time frames across the pandemic. Twitter timelines of 4,735 users from London and New York were investigated to shed light on potential fluctuations of several psychological states and constructs related to the pandemic. Moving averages are presented for the years 2020 and 2019. Further, mixed negative binomial regression models were fitted to estimate monthly word counts for the time before and during the pandemic. Several psychological states and constructs fluctuated heavily on Twitter during 2020 but not during 2019. Substantial increases in levels of sadness, anxiety, anger, and concerns about home and health were observed around the first lockdown periods in both cities. The levels of most constructs decreased after the initial spike, but negative emotions such as sadness, anxiety, and anger remained elevated throughout 2020 compared to the year prior to the pandemic. Tweets from both cities showed remarkably similar temporal patterns, and there are similarities to reactions found on Twitter following other previous traumatic events.',\n",
       " 'Integrating online and offline data is critical for uncovering the interdependence between policy and public emotional and behavioral responses in order to aid the development of effective spatially targeted interventions during crises. As the COVID-19 pandemic began to sweep across the US it elicited a wide spectrum of responses, both online and offline, across the population. Here, we analyze around 13 million geotagged tweets in 49 cities across the US from the first few months of the pandemic to assess regional dependence in online sentiments with respect to a few major COVID-19 related topics, and how these sentiments correlate with policy development and human mobility. In this study, we observe universal trends in overall and topic-based sentiments across cities over the time period studied. We also find that this online geolocalized emotion is significantly impacted by key COVID-19 policy events. However, there is significant variation in the emotional responses to these policies across the cities studied. Online emotional responses are also found to be a good indicator for predicting offline local mobility, while the correlations between these emotional responses and local cases and deaths are relatively weak. Our findings point to a feedback loop between policy development, public emotional responses, and local mobility, as well as provide new insights for integrating online and offline data for crisis management.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health concerns (such as fear and loneliness) have been actively discussed on social media. We aim to examine mental health discussions on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and infer the demographic composition of Twitter users who had mental health concerns.MethodsCOVID-19-related tweets from March 5th, 2020, to January 31st, 2021, were collected through Twitter streaming API using keywords (ie,“corona,”“covid19,” and “covid”). By further filtering using keywords (ie,“depress,”“failure,” and “hopeless”), we extracted mental health-related tweets from the US. Topic modeling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model was conducted to monitor users’ discussions surrounding mental health concerns. Deep learning algorithms were performed to infer the demographic composition of Twitter users who had mental health concerns during the pandemic.ResultsWe observed a positive correlation between mental health concerns on Twitter and the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Topic modeling showed that “stay-at-home,”“death poll,” and “politics and policy” were the most popular topics in COVID-19 mental health tweets. Among Twitter users who had mental health concerns during the pandemic, Males, White, and 30-49 age group people were more likely to express mental health concerns. In addition, Twitter users from the east and west coast had more mental health concerns.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on mental health concerns on Twitter in the US.

       " 'Exoskeletons have emerged as a vital technology in the last decade and a half, with diverse use cases in different domains. Even though several works related to the analysis of Tweets about emerging technologies exist, none of those works have focused on the analysis of Tweets about exoskeletons. The work of this paper aims to address this research gap by presenting multiple novel findings from a comprehensive analysis of about 150,000 Tweets about exoskeletons posted between May 2017 and May 2023. First, findings from temporal analysis of these Tweets reveal the specific months per year when a significantly higher volume of Tweets was posted and the time windows when the highest number of Tweets, the lowest number of Tweets, Tweets with the highest number of hashtags, and Tweets with the highest number of user mentions were posted. Second, the paper shows that there are statistically significant correlations between the number of Tweets posted per hour and the different characteristics of these Tweets. Third, the paper presents a multiple linear regression model to predict the number of Tweets posted per hour in terms of these characteristics of Tweets. The R2score of this model was observed to be 0.9540. Fourth, the paper reports that the 10 most popular hashtags were #exoskeleton, #robotics, #iot, #technology, #tech, #innovation, #ai, #sci, #construction and #news. Fifth, sentiment analysis of these Tweets was performed, and the results show that the percentages of positive, neutral, and negative Tweets were 46.8%, 33.1%, and 20.1%, respectively. To add to this, in the Tweets that did not express a neutral sentiment, the sentiment of surprise was the most common sentiment. It was followed by sentiments of joy, disgust, sadness, fear, and anger, respectively. Furthermore, hashtag-specific sentiment analysis revealed several novel insights. For instance, for almost all the months in 2022, the usage of #ai in Tweets about exoskeletons was mainly associated with a positive sentiment. Sixth, lexicon-based approaches were used to detect possibly sarcastic Tweets and Tweets that contained news, and the results are presented. Finally, a comparison of positive Tweets, negative Tweets, neutral Tweets, possibly sarcastic Tweets, and Tweets that contained news is presented in terms of the different characteristic properties of these Tweets. The findings reveal multiple novel insights related to the similarities, variations, and trends of character count, hashtag usage, and user mentions in such Tweets during this time range.',\n",

       " \"The growing trend of partisanship in news reporting can have a negative impact on society. Assessing the level of partisanship in news headlines is particularly crucial, as they are easily accessible and frequently provide a condensed summary of the article's opinions or events. Therefore, they can significantly influence readers' decision to read the full article, making them a key factor in shaping public opinion. We first adopt a human-guided machine learning framework to develop a new dataset for hyperpartisan news title detection with 2,200 manually labeled and 1.8 million machine-labeled titles that were posted from 2014 to the present by nine representative media organizations across three media bias groups-Left, Central, and Right in an active learning manner. A fine-tuned transformer-based language model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.84 and an F1 score of 0.78 on an external validation set. Next, we conduct a computational analysis to quantify the extent and dynamics of partisanship in news titles. While some aspects are as expected, our study reveals new or nuanced differences between the three media groups. We find that overall the Right media tends to use proportionally more hyperpartisan titles. Roughly around the 2016 Presidential Election, the proportions of hyperpartisan titles increased across all media bias groups, with the Left media exhibiting the most significant relative increase. We identify three major topics including foreign issues, political systems, and societal issues that are suggestive of hyperpartisanship in news titles using logistic regression models and the Shapley values. Through an analysis of the topic distribution, we find that societal issues gradually gain more attention from all media groups. We further apply a lexicon-based language analysis tool to the titles of each topic and quantify the linguistic distance between any pairs of the three media groups, uncovering three distinct patterns.

With the wide adoption and use of social media platforms, the posts of someone give a window to his or her mind that can help detect mental health issues. Numerous researches were done to identify mental health conditions from posts in English language. Very few were done for Arabic language using traditional natural language processing (NLP) models. In this novel research, we use the latest NLP models, namely Bidirectional Encoded from Representations Transformers (BERT), for detecting depression in Arabic social media posts. We built CairoDep, a set of models and a benchmark dataset for this purpose. First, we built CairoDep v1.0 dataset, a labeled dataset of 7000 posts including 3400 normal (non-depressed) posts and 3600 depressed posts. Our dataset was collected from multiple sources, specifically crowdsourcing, Arabic mental health forums and pages, readily available datasets and translation from English datasets. Second, we further trained two pre-trained BERT transformers for Arabic language to detect depression from Arabic posts in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectic Arabic, namely ARABERT and MARBERT. We further trained and evaluated them on the dataset using 80%-20% split. We achieved accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score values of 96.93%, 96.92%, 96.93% and 96.92% for ARABERT and of 96.07%, 96.11%, 96.04% and 96.07% for MARBERT respectively. These results are quite superior to the results reported in the literature for depression detection using lexicon analysis or traditional machine learning techniques. They open the door for deploying NLP transformers to develop mental health AI-powered applications and platforms for Arabic speakers. We developed these models as part of iHayaNow, an AI-based mental health helpline and a holistic platform for Arabic speakers that is under research and development.',\n",

Insurance, as a vast and complex discipline, involves a wide variety of data forms in its operational processes, including text, images, and videos, thereby giving rise to diverse multimodal tasks. Despite this, there has been limited systematic exploration of multimodal tasks specific to insurance, nor a thorough investigation into how LMMs can address these challenges. In this paper, we explore GPT-4V's capabilities in the insurance domain. We categorize multimodal tasks by focusing primarily on visual aspects based on types of insurance (e.g., auto, household/commercial property, health, and agricultural insurance) and insurance stages (e.g., risk assessment, risk monitoring, and claims processing). Our experiment reveals that GPT-4V exhibits remarkable abilities in insurance-related tasks, demonstrating not only a robust understanding of multimodal content in the insurance domain but also a comprehensive knowledge of insurance scenarios. However, there are notable shortcomings: GPT-4V struggles with detailed risk rating and loss assessment, suffers from hallucination in image understanding, and shows variable support for different languages. Through this work, we aim to bridge the insurance domain with cutting-edge LMM technology, facilitate interdisciplinary exchange and development, and provide a foundation for the continued advancement and evolution of future research endeavors.\",\n",

The goal of this study is to use classical machine learning approaches to classify tweets into COVID-PTSD positive or negative categories. To this end, we employed various Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, to segregate the psychotic difficulties with the user’s PTSD in the context of COVID-19, including Random Forest Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor. ML models are trained and tested using various combinations of feature selection strategies to get the best possible combination.

Traditional methods face barriers when detecting and diagnosing depression, including social stigma and societal labeling. As social media platforms became commonplace for information sharing, their anonymity meant that the barriers had considerably lessened. An alternative method to depression detection being researched is using social media data to build machine learning models for depression detection. To that end, this research uses machine learning models to incorporate new user networks and user engagement features into depression detection on Twitter users. These two features provide an additional understanding of users and may significantly affect depression detection. A Twitter dataset is constructed to include additional data on users' following list and the history of liked tweets not examined in prior studies. Ten machine learning models are constructed using five different machine learning algorithms tested on two sets of features. Models with proposed features outperformed other machine learning models without proposed features, with the best model yielding 82.05% performance for both accuracy and F1 score. This study discovered that the most important feature is the number of depression keywords in liked tweets, with at least twice the gain compared to 88% of other features used. Topic modelling features for liked tweets also have high gain and are important in detecting depression. Additionally, features derived from original tweets, replies, and liked tweets have higher gain and are more important than retweets and quote tweets in detecting depression.\",\n",

Among the mental illnesses that most afflict the population is depression; its early diagnosis is vitally important, as it can trigger more severe illnesses, such as suicidal ideation. Due to the lack of homogeneity in current diagnostic tools, the community has focused on using AI tools for opportune diagnosis. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data that allows the use of IA tools for the Spanish language. Our work has a cross-lingual scheme to address this issue, allowing us to identify Spanish and English texts. The experiments demonstrated the methodology’s effectiveness with an F1-score of 0.95. With this methodology, we propose a method to solve a classification problem for depression tweets (or short texts) by reusing English language databases with insufficient data to generate a classification model, such as in the Spanish language. We also validated the information obtained with public data to analyze the behavior of depression in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic.

       " \"Early depression detection is crucial for both people at risk and the whole society. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the depression level is expected to get higher. Social media is an affluent source of users' opinions and feelings that can be used to detect depression. Depression detection from users' tweets is a challenging task that many researchers have tried to tackle recently as it depends on the whole tweet context. This work introduces a machine learning-based approach for depression detection from tweets. We first obtained a tweets depression detection dataset and use it to train different machine learning and deep learning models for depression detection. We trained some classical machine learning models, then we also fine-tuned the state-of-the-art transformer-based pre-trained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, MobileBERT, and DistilBERT. Our best model was RoBERTa gaining a 78.85 percent F1-score on the test set. This model has then been used to pseudo-label two different datasets of about 4.35 million tweets from about 1 million Twitter users related to COVID-19 and vaccination to gain more deep insights on COVID-19 effect on the depression level of social media users. We show that depression level got doubled from four percent to eight percent from the beginning to the end of March 2020. Depression also increased after nearly two years to reach 15 percent in December 2021. The boosting of the level of depression should be taken into consideration by mental health institutions.\",\n",
       " 'Predicting depression intensity from microblogs and social media posts has numerous benefits and applications, including predicting early psychological disorders and stress in individuals or the general public. A major challenge in predicting depression using social media posts is that the existing studies do not focus on predicting the intensity of depression in social media texts but rather only perform the binary classification of depression and moreover noisy data makes it difficult to predict the true depression in the social media text. This study intends to begin by collecting relevant Tweets and generating a corpus of 210000 public tweets using Twitter public application programming interfaces (APIs). A strategy is devised to filter out only depression-related tweets by creating a list of relevant hashtags to reduce noise in the corpus. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to annotate the data into three depression classes: ‘Mild,’ ‘Moderate,’ and ‘Severe,’ based on International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) depression diagnostic criteria. Different baseline classifiers are applied to the annotated dataset to get a preliminary idea of classification performance on the corpus. Further FastText-based model is applied and fine-tuned with different preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning to produce the tuned model, which significantly increases the depression classification performance to an 84% F1 score and 90% accuracy compared to baselines. Finally, a FastText-based weighted soft voting ensemble (WSVE) is proposed to boost the model’s performance by combining several other classifiers and assigning weights to individual models according to their individual performances. The proposed WSVE outperformed all baselines as well as FastText alone, with an F1 of 89%, 5% higher than FastText alone, and an accuracy of 93%, 3% higher than FastText alone. The proposed model better captures the contextual features of the relatively small sample class and aids in the detection of early depression intensity prediction from tweets with impactful performances.',\n",

Amidst this global health crisis, social media platforms have emerged as vibrant arenas for discussing the COVID-19 pandemic. Delving into the emotional undercurrents of social media discourse is paramount to safeguarding societies from the pandemic's devastating effects. Sentiment analysis, a powerful tool for text analysis, proves particularly challenging when applied to the nuanced and often colloquial language of tweets. This methodology automates the identification and assessment of opinions and emotions encapsulated within unstructured data. Sentiment analysis tools meticulously examine texts sourced from a variety of outlets, which includes data sourced from spam mail, fake scrutiny of public opinion, malicious retrospection, media posts, and articles on the web, extracting meaning from these diverse repositories of human expression. Using the applications of various language learning techniques and ML techniques, behavioral analysis assigns values to the sentiment following the entities, topics, themes, and categories, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of sentiments. Machine learning algorithms, having been trained on extensive collections of text-emotion examples, continuously enhance their ability to discern sentiment without human intervention. Particularly crucial during a pandemic, the analysis of social media texts unveils valuable insights into prevailing sentimental trends, contributing to a profound understanding of societal needs and the anticipation of future trends.

It enables the extraction of valuable insights from natural language, facilitating endeavors like personality traits assessment, mental health monitoring, and sentiment analysis in interpersonal communications. In text analysis, existing studies often resort to either human coding, which is time-consuming, using pre-built dictionaries, which often fails to cover all possible scenarios, or training models from scratch, which requires large amounts of labeled data. In this tutorial, we introduce the pretrain-finetune paradigm. The pretrain-finetune paradigm represents a transformative approach in text analysis and natural language processing. This paradigm distinguishes itself through the use of large pretrained language models, demonstrating remarkable efficiency in finetuning tasks, even with limited training data. This efficiency is especially beneficial for research in social sciences, where the number of annotated samples is often quite limited. Our tutorial offers a comprehensive introduction to the pretrain-finetune paradigm. We first delve into the fundamental concepts of pretraining and finetuning, followed by practical exercises using real-world applications.

Objectives 1) Identify and describe language used on social media that is associated with discourse about depression. 2) Describe the associations between identified language and COVID-19 incidence over time across several geographies. Methods We create a word embedding based on the posts in Reddit’s /r/Depression and use this word embedding to train representations of active authors. We contrast these authors against a control group and extract keywords that capture differences between the two groups. We filter these keywords for face validity and to match character limits of an information retrieval system, Elasticsearch. We retrieve all geo-tagged posts on Twitter from April 2019 to June 2021 from Seattle, Sydney, Mumbai, and Toronto. The tweets are scored with BM25 using the keywords. We call this score rDD. We compare changes in average score over time with case counts from the pandemic’s beginning through June 2021. Results We observe a pattern in rDD across all cities analyzed: There is an increase in rDD near the start of the pandemic which levels off over time. However, in Mumbai we also see an increase aligned with a second wave of cases. Conclusions Our results are concordant with other studies which indicate that the impact of the pandemic on mental health was highest initially and was followed by recovery, largely unchanged by subsequent waves. However, in the Mumbai data we observed a substantial rise in rDD with a large second wave.

Furthermore, different scientific institutions and companies are attempting to accelerate research and innovation by analyzing large data corpus for fighting against the pandemic. In this research study, an advanced approach based on automated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is suggested dealing with a large data corpus for efficiently providing visualization of sentiment analysis and discovered topics. This innovative approach seeks to interrogate a substantial pandemic corpus, delving into the intricacies of public sentiment and discerning evolving trends pertinent to the pandemic. A sophisticated 10-topic LDA model was implemented, revealing Topic 8 as the most prevalent, with a frequency peak of 22.29, eclipsing other enumerated topics. We employ text-mining techniques like WordCloud and Word2Vec to offer insights into specific terms relevant to the pandemic, such as “Origin,” “Symptom,” “Diagnostic,” and “Transmission.” Applying the t-SNE method enriches the analysis by visually unraveling semantic clusters within the corpus. The subsequent phase involves modeling strategic topics within the corpus through an unsupervised LDA-based approach, leveraging our suggested framework.

       " 'Bipolar disorder is a disorder in which a person expresses manic and depressed emotions repeatedly. Diagnosing bipolar disorder accurately can be difficult because other mood disorders or even regular mood changes may have similar symptoms. Therefore, psychiatrists need to spend a long time observing and interviewing clients to make the diagnosis. Recent studies have trained machine learning models for detecting bipolar disorder on social media. However, most of these studies focused on increasing the accuracy of the model without explaining the classification results. Although the posts of a bipolar disorder user can be observed manually, doing so is not practical since a user can have many posts which may not depict any signs of bipolar disorder. Without any explanations, the trustworthiness of the model decreases. We propose a deep learning model that not only detects and classifies bipolar disorder users but also explains how the model generates the classification results. The posts are first grouped using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a method commonly used to classify the topic of a text. These groups are then input into the model, and attention mechanisms are utilized to determine which groups have more attention weights and are considered more heavily. Finally, an explanation of the classification results is obtained by visualizing the attention weights. Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the explanations generated through our proposed model.

       " \"The Covid-19 outbreak has an unprecedented effects on people's daily lives throughout the world, causing immense stress amongst individuals owing to enhanced psychological disorders like depression, stress, and anxiety. Researchers have used social media data to detect behaviour changes in individuals with depression, postpartum changes and stress detection since it reveals critical aspects of mental and emotional diseases. Considerable efforts have been made to examine the psychological health of people which have limited performance in accuracy and demand increased training time. To conquer such issues, this paper proposes an efficient depression detection framework named Improved Chimp Optimization Algorithm based Convolution Neural Network–Long Short Term Memory and Natural Language Processing for Covid-19 Twitter data. In the proposed method, the tweets are pre-processed, user's frequent tweet identification, and hash tag identification has been done. The processed tweets are then clustered through cluster head selection using Swap-Displacement-Reversion-Bull based Optimization Algorithm and cluster formation using the Bregman distance-based K-Means algorithm. Then, the psycholinguistic features are extracted from the clustered data and inputted to the Improved Chimp Optimization Algorithm-based-Convolution Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory network for depression classification. Preliminary results show that the proposed method provides greater performance with 97.7% efficiency and outperforms the existing methodologies.\",\n",
       " \"With the advent of technological advancements and the widespread Internet connectivity during the last couple of decades, social media platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) have consumed a large proportion of time in our daily lives. People tend to stay alive on their social media with recent updates, as it has become the primary source of interaction within social circles. Although social media platforms offer several remarkable features but are simultaneously prone to various critical vulnerabilities. Recent studies have revealed a strong correlation between the usage of social media and associated mental health issues consequently leading to depression, anxiety, suicide commitment, and mental disorder, particularly in the young adults who have excessively spent time on social media which necessitates a thorough psychological analysis of all these platforms. This study aims to exploit machine learning techniques for the classification of psychotic issues based on Facebook status updates. In this paper, we start with depression detection in the first instance and then expand on analyzing six other psychotic issues (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychopathic deviate, hypochondria, unrealistic, and hypomania) commonly found in adults due to extreme use of social media networks. To classify the psychotic issues with the user's mental state, we have employed different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers i.e., Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The used ML models are trained and tested by using different combinations of features selection techniques. To observe the most suitable classifiers for psychotic issue classification, a cost-benefit function (sometimes termed as ‘Suitability’) has been used which combines the accuracy of the model with its execution time. The experimental evidence argues that RF outperforms its competitor classifiers with the unigram feature set.\",\n",

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a current pandemic that has sparked widespread concern worldwide. Spreading misleading information on social media platforms like Twitter, on the other hand, is exacerbating the disease’s concern. This research aims to examine tweets and develop a model that can detect public sentiment from social media posts; consequently, necessary precautions can be taken to preserve adequate validity of information for the general public. We believe that various social media platforms have a significant impact on creating public awareness about the disease’s importance and encouraging preventive measures among community members. For this study, we applied the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, a new deep-learning technique for text analysis and performance with exceptional multi-class accuracy.

       " 'The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) generated a need to quickly and accurately assemble up-to-date information related to its spread. In this research article, we propose two methods in which Twitter is useful when modelling the spread of COVID-19: (1) machine learning algorithms trained in English, Spanish, German, Portuguese and Italian are used to identify symptomatic individuals derived from Twitter. Using the geo-location attached to each tweet, we map users to a geographic location to produce a time-series of potential symptomatic individuals. We calibrate an extended SEIRD epidemiological model with combinations of low-latency data feeds, including the symptomatic tweets, with death data and infer the parameters of the model. We then evaluate the usefulness of the data feeds when making predictions of daily deaths in 50 US States, 16 Latin American countries, 2 European countries and 7 NHS (National Health Service) regions in the UK. We show that using symptomatic tweets can result in a 6% and 17% increase in mean squared error accuracy, on average, when predicting COVID-19 deaths in US States and the rest of the world, respectively, compared to using solely death data. (2) Origin/destination (O/D) matrices, for movements between seven NHS regions, are constructed by determining when a user has tweeted twice in a 24 h period in two different locations. We show that increasing and decreasing a social connectivity parameter within an SIR model affects the rate of spread of a disease.',\n",

To facilitate such analyses, we construct, validate, and release publicly the representative DADIT dataset of 30M tweets of 20k Italian Twitter users, along with their bios and profile pictures. We enrich the user data with high-quality labels for gender, age, and location. DADIT enables us to train and compare the performance of various state-of-the-art models for the prediction of the gender and age of social media users. In particular, we investigate if tweets contain valuable information for the task, since popular classifiers like M3 don't leverage them. Our best XLM-based classifier improves upon the commonly used competitor M3 by up to 53% F1. Especially for age prediction, classifiers profit from including tweets as features. We also confirm these findings on a German test set.\",\n",

Multiple surveys have been published on this topic, providing the community with comprehensive accounts of the research in this area. Among all mental health conditions, depression is the most widely studied due to its worldwide prevalence. The COVID-19 global pandemic, starting in early 2020, has had a great impact on mental health worldwide. Harsh measures employed by governments to slow the spread of the virus (e.g., lockdowns) and the subsequent economic downturn experienced in many countries have significantly impacted people's lives and mental health. Studies have shown a substantial increase of above 50% in the rate of depression in the population. In this context, we present a survey on natural language processing (NLP) approaches to modeling depression in social media, providing the reader with a post-COVID-19 outlook. This survey contributes to the understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on modeling depression in social media.

The ever-expanding volume of online data available on the global network necessitates the use of specialized techniques and methods to effectively analyse and utilize this vast amount of information. This study's objective is to comprehend the textual information at the Lexical and Semantic level and to extract sentiments from this information in the most accurate way possible. To achieve this, the paper proposes to cluster semantically related words by evaluating their lexical similarity with respect to feature and sequence vectors. The proposed method utilizes Natural Language Processing, semantic and lexical clustering and hybrid C4.5 algorithm to extract six subcategories of emotions over three classes of sentiments based on word-based analysis of text.

Unfortunately, different mental illnesses have similar symptoms, which makes detection very challenging. The present study conducts an examination of depressed users on the social media platform Twitter, utilizing the CLPsych 2015 database. In addition to conducting an analysis of symptoms and emotions as in current research, we have incorporated temporal analysis. This innovative approach has enabled us to differentiate between two prevalent forms of depression: Major Depressive Disorder and Persistent Depressive Disorder. Features proposed for each disorder were used to improve the results. A Convolutional Neural Network and an XGBoost model were used to classify users into depressive and non-depressive users using GloVe and TF-IDF as word embeddings, respectively. We obtained better results 0.8843 accuracy, 0.8751 F1-score, 0.885 precision, 0.8704 recall, and 0.862 AUC for the CNN model. The results were higher than the state of the art except for the AUC metric when the features of each disease were added. Both algorithms had similar behaviors, but XGBoost had a lower variance. Our study shows that incorporating temporal analysis is an important feature in diagnosing depression on social media because depressed users may experience different symptoms based on the type of depression they experience.',\n",

Building on this line of inquiry, this study explores the impact of emotional elements and sentiment analysis within abstracts published in the journal Nature over the past 10 years, adopting an affective-centric perspective on scientific endeavors. The research aims to explore the presence and trends of emotional elements and sentiments in these abstracts and to investigate the correlation between these emotional elements and citation counts, considering the influence of emotions on decision-making. The novelty of this research lies in not only considering sentiment analysis but also employing two distinct emotion detection techniques on the abstracts. The study employs a hybrid approach that integrates Lexicon-based, Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) sentiment analysis methods to explore diverse emotional dimensions through text emotion detection.

Long observation time is needed before a psychiatrist diagnoses BD to avoid misdiagnosing it as depression. Recently, deep learning models have been used for detecting BD and depression. However, because of the limitations of accessing healthcare data, such as the privacy of the data, it is difficult to collect large amounts of data to train the models. Alternatively, studies on detecting BD and depression were conducted using social media data because people often express their emotions in social media posts. The posts can be represented as text features using word embedding models, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Recently, transformer-based word embedding models were fine-tuned using biomedical, clinical, and mental health domain data, improving the performance of detecting depression. However, the potential of those fine-tuned word embeddings specific for detecting BD has yet to be explored. In this study, we compared some fine-tuned word embeddings, analyzed the impact of using different domain knowledge in the fine-tuning process for detecting BD, and identified the limitation of using word embedding in detecting BD. Based on our experiments, the models achieve excellent performance with an F1-Score above or equal to 0.90. However, the performance of these models is not significantly different unless more computationally expensive models are used in the fine-tuning process of the word embedding models. Our experiment results also show that different types of domain knowledge in the fine-tuning process have no significant impact on detecting BD. Additionally, the instability in emotion cannot be identified and explained from the posts using word embeddings, decreasing the model's reliability and limiting the use of word embeddings for BD detection.\",\n",

       " 'Identifying those at risk for depression is a crucial issue and social media provides an excellent platform for examining the linguistic patterns of depressed individuals. A significant challenge in depression classification problems is ensuring that prediction models are not overly dependent on topic keywords (i.e., depression keywords) such that it fails to predict when such keywords are unavailable. One promising approach is masking—that is, by selectively masking various words and asking the model to predict the masked words, the model is forced to learn the inherent language patterns of depression. This study evaluates seven masking techniques. Moreover, predicting the masked words during the pre-training or fine-tuning phase was also examined. Last, six class imbalanced ratios were compared to determine the robustness of masked words selection methods. Key findings demonstrate that selective masking outperforms random masking in terms of F1-score. The most accurate and robust models are identified. Our research also indicates that reconstructing the masked words during the pre-training phase is more advantageous than during the fine-tuning phase. Further discussion and implications are discussed.

       " \"The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most highly discussed topics throughout its entire lifespan. This pandemic has caused huge losses throughout the world, ranging from economic losses to a massive death toll of over five million that is still growing. One aspect has not been touched on nearly as much as the impact on mental health worldwide. We decided to study the pandemic's impact on peoples’ mental health, specifically depression and the many symptoms that come with it. Twitter was used for this study as it has many raw and unfiltered personal sentiments from its many users. Twitter also has a helpful developer API that allows tweets to be queried at a massive scale. Throughout our research, we found that the number of people discussing COVID-19 depression was much higher during the first six months of the pandemic. However, during the following six months, those still suffering from such depression were experiencing worse symptoms with greater frequency.\",\n",

This work aims to study depression during the COVID-19 among the educational sector and to develop a novel stroop test based depression detection system by analyzing the response time (RT) for normal stroop test (ST) and emotional stroop test (EST). The data for this work is collected from 44 participants. It is found that 66% of the participants have depression. The analysis of RT for ST and EST before and after showing video stimulus, indicates that there is a significant difference in change of response time (dRT) for both normal and depressive cases. Further this feature along with the physiological parameters (PhyP) of the participants are given to support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) classifier to develop depression detection systems. The XGBoost provides highest accuracy of 85.71% with PhyP + ST_dRT data and an accuracy of 71.43% with PhyP + EST_dRT data. Therefore, the proposed systems may serve as a screening tool for depression during this pandemic situation.',\n",

Due to the virus, many people have died, and many hospitalized. A record number of people have lost their job, and many businesses have closed. The global economy is at risk. People are facing new realities of their lives. Studies have shown that the level of depression is three times higher than before this pandemic. Previous studies have shown that people use social media to express their emotions and feelings. The purpose of this study is to understand the depression during this COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. To study the depression-related tweets, I have used a COVID-19 related dataset that is made available by IEEE. Regarding methods, I have employed unsupervised techniques such as clustering and topic modeling. Besides, I have used sentiment analysis to understand the emotions and subjectivity in the clusters. The result from the analysis shows the change of depression related discussions during this pandemic over a five and a half months period of time. It also shows the characteristics of the overall discussion around depression. The findings may be useful for future depression studies.',\n",

Accordingly, a city's music charts may reflect consistencies and patterns in the collective emotional experiences of its residents. In this paper, we report a dataset of arousal and valence-related music features collected from songs on Top-25 charts from 106 cities around the world, over a period of 158 days. Chart information was obtained from the Apple Music platform, and music features were obtained from Spotify. We visualize daily fluctuations of features corresponding to intensity arousal (energy, loudness), rhythmic arousal (danceability, tempo) and valence, highlighting trends in nine major cities across six continents, and conduct k-means clustering of all 106 cities from these five music features. Preliminary results suggest consistencies between our music feature data and previous literature, in reflecting cultural differences for preferred arousal levels in music. We also discuss possible implications of our paper and data in the use of music streaming charts as indicators for collective emotional experience.\",\n",
       " 'Developing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms has been an active area of research. Extensions of the original Metropolis-Hastings random walk (MHRW) algorithm, such as Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), include gradient information about the posterior when proposing parameters in areas of higher probability within the target. Particle-Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) is a similar parameter estimation algorithm that utilises a particle filter to calculate an unbiased estimate of the log-likelihood which can be used in the MHRW algorithm. However, as noted in the literature, obtaining gradients of the log-likelihood wrt the parameters is difficult due to operations inherent to the particle filter being non-differentiable. This obstacle has hindered the use of gradient based proposals within p-MCMC. Therefore, in this thesis, a novel method for obtaining the gradient of the log-likelihood wrt the parameters by fixing the random number seed within the particle filter is considered. This allows the particle filter to be posed as a deterministic function, ie running the particle filter multiple times will result in the same resampling realisations, log-likelihood and associated gradient estimates. When a different resampling realisation occurs between two parameter values, a piecewise continuous estimate of the log-likelihood and gradient occurs.',\n",

Alberta as other provinces and countries had to face the challenge of fighting this syndrome that caused what is commonly known as the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures put in place by the government officials to fight the pandemic brought about big changes to the lives of Albertans. This study sought to explore the discourse that happened online about the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta. One might expect that the discourse will change with changes in the gravity of the pandemic. But is this the case? Using tweets scraped from Twitter, the relationships between scores of positive and negative sentiments in these tweets and the number of patients in ICU, wave of the pandemic, mentions of oneself and people identified with (Us pronouns) and mentions of the other and people not identified with (Them pronouns) was explored using visualisations and statistical analysis tools. Three methods of measuring sentiments were used and the methods compared. Results showed that the discourse on the pandemic became less positive as we moved from the first to the fourth wave. A multiple linear regression showed that the best predictors of the sentiment score of the discourse was the wave of the pandemic and the use of Them pronouns. Comparison of the sentiment measuring methods suggested that the changes in the use of positive and negative words are not accompanied by a proportional change in the sentiment in the discourse. As expected, the number of patients in ICU correlated negatively with positive sentiment scores and positively negative sentiment scores. Unlike expected, the use of the Us and Them pronouns had similar correlations in magnitude and direction with sentiment scores.

       " \"Social media has emerged as a popular platform for sports fans to express their opinions regarding athletes' performance. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is widely recognized as one of the most popular sports leagues globally. However, an unfortunate aspect that has emerged in recent years is the presence of abusive fans within the league. Consequently, the focus of this research is to identify which NBA athletes experience abuse on Twitter and delve deeper into the underlying reasons behind such mistreatment. To address the research questions at hand, the study employs a curated set of keywords to query the Twitter API, gathering a comprehensive collection of tweets that potentially contain hate speech directed toward NBA players. A deep learning classification model is implemented, effectively identifying tweets that genuinely exhibit hate speech. We further use keyword search methods to detect the specific groups that are targeted by hate speech the most and identify topics of hate speech tweets. The findings of our research indicate that certain groups of athletes are particularly vulnerable to hate speech from fans. Notably, high-performing athletes, Black athletes, overweight athletes, short athletes, and athletes associated with the LGBTQ community are found to be highly susceptible to abusive remarks. Racism, physique shaming, play style, and anti-LGBTQ remarks are the major themes. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the challenges faced by NBA athletes in the digital space and provide a foundation for developing strategies to combat hate speech and foster a more inclusive environment for all individuals involved in the NBA community.\",\n",
       " 'We conduct a large-scale social media-based study of oral health during the COVID-19 pandemic based on tweets from 9,104 Twitter users across 26 states (with sufficient samples) in the United States for the period between November 12, 2020 and June 14, 2021. To better understand how discussions on different topics/oral diseases vary across the users, we acquire or infer demographic information of users and other characteristics, including age, gender, income, population density, poverty rate, health insurance coverage rate, community water fluoridation rate, and relative change in the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases based on retrieved information from user profiles. Women and younger adults (19-29) are more likely to talk about oral health problems. We use the LDA topic model to extract the major topics/oral diseases in tweets. Overall, 26.70% of the Twitter users talk about wisdom tooth pain/jaw hurt, 23.86% tweet about dental service/cavity, 18.97% discuss chipped tooth/tooth break, 16.23% talk about dental pain, and the rest are about tooth decay/gum bleeding. By conducting logistic regression, we find that discussions vary across user characteristics. More importantly, we find social disparities in oral health during the pandemic. Specifically, we find that health insurance coverage rate is the most significant predictor in logistic regression for topic prediction. People from counties with higher insurance coverage tend to tweet less about all topics of oral diseases. People from counties at a higher risk of COVID-19 talk more about tooth decay/gum bleeding and chipped tooth/tooth break. Older adults (≥ 50), who are vulnerable to COVID-19, are more likely to discuss dental pain. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to analyze and understand oral health in America amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope the findings of our study through the lens of social media can provide insights for oral health practitioners and policy makers.',\n",

Previous research on flourishing and its three defining components has suggested a decline of emotional, social and psychological well-being since the start of the pandemic, but studies were largely done on quantitative data. Explorations of qualitative data on flourishing also show little use of automatic analysis, like the linguistic analysis tool LIWC. This study focuses on comparing the differences in language use related to the three well-being components within flourishing definitions before and during the pandemic using LIWC. A repeated cross-sectional design with three independent German samples was used to extract qualitative data on definitions of flourishing in 2019, 2020 and 2021. A total of 232 participants gave responses from a layperson’s point of view. The data was analyzed through linguistic analysis using LIWC2015 and ANOVAs. The results showed slight variations between the frequencies of LIWC categories, but overall showed no differences related to either of the three well-being components in the definitions of flourishing between the three years. Only occupation appeared less relevant in flourishing definitions during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. Flourishing definitions and the relevance of emotional, social and psychological well-being to its experience seem to remain stable despite adverse events such as the pandemic. The lower mention of occupation during the pandemic might be explained by the restrictions imposed in Germany. LIWC was fairly useful as an analysis tool within the framework of the well-being components, but social well-being was not measured in all aspects and the use of the German LIWC2001 dictionary restricted the measurement of psychological well-being, which should be considered in future applications.',\n",

To aid the development of effective spatially targeted interventions in the midst of this turmoil, it is important to understand the geolocalization of these online emotional responses, as well as their association with offline behavioral responses. Here, we analyze around 13 million geotagged tweets in 49 cities across the US from the first few months of the pandemic to assess regional dependence in online sentiments with respect to a few major topics, and how these sentiments correlate with policy development and human mobility. Surprisingly, we observe universal trends in overall and topic-based sentiments across cities over the time period studied, with variability primarily seen only in the immediate impact of federal guidelines and local lockdown policies. We also find that these local sentiments are highly correlated with and predictive of city-level mobility, while the correlations between sentiments and local cases and deaths are relatively weak. Our findings point to widespread commonalities in the online public emotional responses to COVID across the US, both temporally and relative to offline indicators, in contrast with the high variability seen in early local containment policies.

One objective of this framework is to reduce the impact of the disaster that affects the lives of the people. Risk communication which is considered as the main function of this framework is also the main key for reducing the amount of affecting people. In this research, the analysis of the effectiveness of the HEALTH-EDRM framework will be defined based on the amount of the COVID-19 affected, death, and the ratio of death and affected cases in Asia Oceania. The paired t-test analysis will be used to compare the effectiveness for dealing with the COVID-19 situation in the aspect of the member of the framework and the economic situation.

Public sentiment on mental health and depression is often captured only in small, survey-based studies, while work based on Twitter data often only looks at the period during the pandemic and does not make comparisons with the pre-pandemic situation. We collected tweets that included the hashtags #MentalHealth and #Depression from before and during the pandemic (8.5 months each). We used LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for topic modeling and LIWC, VADER, and NRC for sentiment analysis. We used three machine-learning classifiers to seek evidence regarding an automatically detectable change in tweetsbeforevs.duringthe pandemic: (1) based on TF-IDF values, (2) based on the values from the sentiment libraries, (3) based on tweet content (deep-learning BERT classifier). Topic modeling revealed that Twitter users who explicitly used the hashtags #Depression and especially #MentalHealth did so to raise awareness. We observed an overall positive sentiment, and in tough times such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, tweets with #MentalHealth were often associated with gratitude. Among the three classification approaches, the BERT classifier showed the best performance, with an accuracy of 81% for #MentalHealth and 79% for #Depression. Although the data may have come from users familiar with mental health, these findings can help gauge public sentiment on the topic. The combination of (1) sentiment analysis, (2) topic modeling, and (3) tweet classification with machine learning proved useful in gaining comprehensive insight into public sentiment and could be applied to other data sources and topics.',\n",

In this study, we perform sentiment analytics on vaccine tweets, monitor changes in public sentiment over time, contrast vaccination sentiment scores with actual vaccination data from the US CDC and the Household Pulse Survey (HPS), explore the influence of maturity of Twitter user-accounts and generate geographic mapping of tweet sentiments. We observe that fear sentiment remained unchanged in populous states, whereas trust sentiment declined slightly in these same states. Changes in sentiments were more notable among less populous states in the central sections of the US. Furthermore, we leverage the emotion polarity based Public Sentiment Scenarios (PSS) framework, which was developed for COVID-19 sentiment analytics, to systematically posit implications for public policy processes with the aim of improving the positioning, messaging, and administration of vaccines. These insights are expected to contribute to policies that can expedite the vaccination program and move the nation closer to the cherished herd immunity goal.',\n",
       " 'Around seven-in-ten Americans use social media (SM) to connect and engage, making these platforms excellent sources of information to understand human behavior and other problems relevant to social sciences. While the presence of a behavior can be detected, it is unclear who or under what circumstances the behavior was generated. Despite the large sample sizes of SM datasets, they almost always come with significant biases, some of which have been studied before. Here, we hypothesize the presence of a largely unrecognized form of bias on SM platforms, calledparticipation bias, that is distinct from selection bias. It is defined as the skew in the demographics of the participants who opt-in to discussions of the topic, compared to the demographics of the underlying SM platform. To infer the participant’s demographics, we propose a novel generative probabilistic framework that links surveys and SM data at the granularity of demographic subgroups (and not individuals). Our method is distinct from existing approaches that elicit such information at the individual level using their profile name, images, and other metadata, thus infringing upon their privacy. We design a statistical simulation to simulate multiple SM platforms and a diverse range of topics to validate the model’s estimates in different scenarios. We use Twitter data as a case study to demonstrate participation bias on the topic of gun violence delineated by political party affiliation and gender. Although Twitter’s user population leans Democratic and has an equal number of men and women according to Pew, our model’s estimates point to the presence of participation bias on the topic of gun control in the opposite direction, with slightly more Republicans than Democrats, and more men compared to women. Our study cautions that in the rush to use digital data for decision-making and understanding public opinions, we must account for the biases inherent in how SM data are produced, lest we may also arrive at biased inferences about the public.',\n",
       " 'Social media has become a vital platform for individuals, organizations, and governments worldwide to communicate and express their views. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, social media sites play a crucial role in people communicating, sharing, and expressing their perceptions on various topics. Analyzing such textual data can improve the response time of governments and organizations to act on alarming issues. This study aims to perform sentiment analysis on the subject of COVID-19 vaccination, perform temporal and spatial analyses of the textual data, and find the most frequently discussed topics that may help organizations bring awareness to those topics. In this work, the sentiment analysis of tweets was performed using 14 different machine learning classifiers and natural language processing (NLP). Lexicon-based TextBlob and Vader are used for annotating the data. A natural language toolkit is used for preprocessing of textual data. Our analysis observed that unigram models outperform bigram and trigram models for all four datasets. Models using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) have higher accuracy than models using count vectorizer. In the count vectorizer class, logistic regression has the best average accuracy with 91.925%. In the TF-IDF class, logistic regression has the best average accuracy of 92%; logistic regression has the highest average recall, F1-score, and ten cross-validation scores, and a ridge classifier has the highest average precision. The unigram models show a standard deviation (SD) of less than 1 for all classifiers except for the Gaussian Naïve Bayes showing 1.18. The experimental results reveal the dates and times in which most positive, negative, and neutral tweets are posted.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination is the most effective way to provide long-lasting immunity against viral infection; thus, rapid assessment of vaccine acceptance is a pressing challenge for health authorities. Prior studies have applied survey techniques to investigate vaccine acceptance, but these may be slow and expensive. This study investigates 29 million vaccine-related tweets from August 8, 2020 to April 19, 2021 and proposes a social media-based approach that derives a vaccine acceptance index (VAI) to quantify Twitter users’ opinions on COVID-19 vaccination. This index is calculated based on opinion classifications identified with the aid of natural language processing techniques and provides a quantitative metric to indicate the level of vaccine acceptance across different geographic scales in the U.S. The VAI is easily calculated from the number of positive and negative Tweets posted by a specific users and groups of users, it can be compiled for regions such a counties or states to provide geospatial information, and it can be tracked over time to assess changes in vaccine acceptance as related to trends in the media and politics. At the national level, it showed that the VAI moved from negative to positive in 2020 and maintained steady after January 2021. Through exploratory analysis of state- and county-level data, reliable assessments of VAI against subsequent vaccination rates could be made for counties with at least 30 users. The paper discusses information characteristics that enable consistent estimation of VAI. The findings support the use of social media to understand opinions and to offer a timely and cost-effective way to assess vaccine acceptance.',\n",
       " 'Pandemics and infectious diseases are overcome by vaccination, which serves as a preventative measure. Nevertheless, vaccines also raise public concerns; public apprehension and doubts challenge the acceptance of new vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines received a similarly hostile reaction from the public. In addition, misinformation from social media, contradictory comments from medical experts, and reports of worse reactions led to negative COVID-19 vaccine perceptions. Many researchers analyzed people’s varying sentiments regarding the COVID-19 vaccine using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. This study is the first attempt to review the role of AI approaches in COVID-19 vaccination-related sentiment analysis. For this purpose, insights from publications are gathered that analyze the (a) approaches used to develop sentiment analysis tools, (b) major sources of data, (c) available data sources, and (d) the public perception of COVID-19 vaccine. Analysis suggests that public perception-related COVID-19 tweets are predominantly analyzed using TextBlob. Moreover, to a large extent, researchers have employed the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model for topic modeling of Twitter data. Another pertinent discovery made in our study is the variation in people’s sentiments regarding the COVID-19 vaccine across different regions. We anticipate that our systematic review will serve as an all-in-one source for the research community in determining the right technique and data source for their requirements. Our findings also provide insight into the research community to assist them in their future work in the current domain.',\n",

       " 'COVID-19 has elicited polarized reactions to public health measures, fueling anti-vaccination movements worldwide which indicate that vaccine hesitancy represents a common expression of dissent. We investigate changes in cognitive (i.e., trust in government, conspiracy beliefs, vaccine attitudes, and other COVID-19-related factors) and socio-emotional factors (i.e., psychological distress and social support) over time, and examine if these factors are associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A sample of Canadian young adults (N=\\u20092,695; 18 to 40 years old) responded to an online survey in May/June 2021 (after the first vaccination campaign) and then in November 2021 (after vaccine mandates were introduced). Based on survey answers, participants were categorized as “not hesitant”, “hesitant”, and “do not intend to get vaccinated” at each time point. Results from generalized estimating equation models indicate that vaccination hesitancy decreased over time. The importance attributed to specific COVID-19-related factors (e.g., research and science about COVID-19 vaccines, opinions of friends and family) decreased whereas psychological distress increased over time. Cognitive and socio-emotional factors were associated with vaccine hesitancy, with participants who did not intend to get vaccinated reporting the lowest psychological distress scores. We argue that dissent may be an empowering way for young people to restore a sense of personal agency via the opposition to a system perceived as illegitimate and/or unfair. These results raise important questions about potential collateral effects of top-down government and public health interventions in times of crisis.',\n",

The tweets were classified into a list of 11 topics and analyzed for trends during the periods before and after the onset of COVID-19. Since the beginning of COVID-19, the percentage of anti-vaccine tweets has increased for two topics, “government and politics” and “conspiracy theories,” and decreased for “developmental disabilities.” Compared to tweets regarding flu and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines, those concerning COVID-19 vaccines showed larger percentages for the topics of conspiracy theories and alternative treatments, and a lower percentage for developmental disabilities. The results support existing anti-vaccine literature and the assertion that anti-vaccine sentiments are an important public-health issue.',\n",

We worked by extracting tweets regarding vaccination in India, building our datasets. We extracted 5977 tweets before the second wave and 42,936 tweets after the second wave. We annotated the collected tweets into four categories, namely Provaccine, Antivaccine, Hesitant and Cognizant.

       " 'Objective To assess spatiotemporal trends in, and determinants of, the acceptance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination globally, as expressed on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Methods We collected over 13\\xa0million posts on the platform regarding COVID-19 vaccination made between November 2020 and March 2022 in 90 languages. Multilingual deep learning XLM-RoBERTa models annotated all posts using an annotation framework after being fine-tuned on 8125 manually annotated, English-language posts. The annotation results were used to assess spatiotemporal trends in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and confidence as expressed by platform users in 135 countries and territories. We identified associations between spatiotemporal trends in vaccine acceptance and country-level characteristics and public policies by using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Findings A greater proportion of platform users in the World Health Organization’s South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific Regions expressed vaccine acceptance than users in the rest of the world. Countries in which a greater proportion of platform users expressed vaccine acceptance had higher COVID-19 vaccine coverage rates. Trust in government was also associated with greater vaccine acceptance. Internationally, vaccine acceptance and confidence declined among platform users as: (i)\\xa0vaccination eligibility was extended to adolescents; (ii)\\xa0vaccine supplies became sufficient; (iii)\\xa0nonpharmaceutical interventions were relaxed; and (iv)\\xa0global reports on adverse events following vaccination appeared. Conclusion Social media listening could provide an effective and expeditious means of informing public health policies during pandemics, and could supplement existing public health surveillance approaches in addressing global health issues.',\n",
       " \"During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy proved to be a major obstacle in efforts to control and mitigate the negative consequences of COVID-19. This study centered on the degree of polarization on social media about vaccine use and contributing factors to vaccine hesitancy among social media users. Examining the discussion about COVID-19 vaccine on the Weibo platform, a relatively comprehensive system of user features was constructed based on psychological theories and models such as the curiosity-drive theory and the big five model of personality. Then machine learning methods were used to explore the paramount impacting factors that led users into polarization. Findings revealed that factors reflecting the activity and effectiveness of social media use promoted user polarization. In contrast, features reflecting users' information processing ability and personal qualities had a negative impact on polarization. This study hopes to help healthcare organizations and governments understand and curb social media polarization around vaccine development in the face of future surges of pandemics.\",\n",
       " 'This study examines the accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination resources in two counties surrounding Newark, NJ in the New York Metropolitan Area, United States. The study area represents diverse population makeups. COVID-19 vaccines were made available by different types of vaccination sites including county mass vaccination sites, medical facilities and pharmacies, and a FEMA community vaccination center in spring 2021. We used the two-step floating catchment area method to measure accessibility and calculated the average accessibility scores of different population groups. We examined the patterns and tested the significance of the differences in accessibility across population groups. The results showed clear spatial heterogeneity in the accessibility to vaccine resources with the existing infrastructure (medical/pharmacy vaccine sites). Accessibility patterns changed with the introduction of county mass sites and the FEMA community site. The county mass vaccination sites in one county greatly increased accessibilities for populations of minority and poverty. The FEMA community site in the other county accomplished the same. Both the local health department and the federal government played an important role in mitigating pre-existing inequalities during the vaccination campaign. Our study shows that social determinants of health need to be addressed and taken into explicit consideration when planning resource distribution during the pandemic.',\n",
       " 'Understanding political polarization on social platforms is important as public opinions may become increasingly extreme when they are circulated in homogeneous communities, thus potentially causing damage in the real world. Automatically detecting the political ideology of social media users can help better understand political polarization. However, it is challenging due to the scarcity of ideology labels, complexity of multimodal contents, and cost of time-consuming data collection process. Most previous frameworks either focus on unimodal content or do not scale up well. In this study, we adopt a heterogeneous graph neural network to jointly model user characteristics, multimodal post contents as well as user-item relations in a bipartite graph to learn a comprehensive and effective user embedding without requiring ideology labels. We apply our framework to online discussions about economy and public health topics. The learned embeddings are then used to detect political ideology and understand political polarization. Our framework outperforms the unimodal, early/late fusion baselines, and homogeneous GNN frameworks by a margin of at least 9% absolute gain in the area under the receiver operating characteristic on two social media datasets. More importantly, our work does not require a time-consuming data collection process, which allows faster detection and in turn allows the policy makers to conduct analysis and design policies in time to respond to crises. We also show that our framework learns meaningful user embeddings and can help better understand political polarization. Notable differences in user descriptions, topics, images, and levels of retweet/quote activities are observed. Our framework for decoding user-content interaction shows wide applicability in understanding political polarization. Furthermore, it can be extended to user-item bipartite information networks for other applications such as content and product recommendation.',\n",
       " 'With the advent of social media, human dynamics studied in purely physical space have been extended to that of a cyber and relational context. However, connections and interactions between these hybrid spaces have not been sufficiently investigated. The “space-place (Splatial)” framework proposed in recent years allows capturing human activities in the hybrid of spaces. This study applies theSplatialframework to examine the information propagation between cyber, relational, and physical spaces through a case study of Covid-19 vaccine debates in New York State (NYS). Whereby the physical space represents the regional boundaries and locations of social media (i.e., Twitter) users in NYS, the relational space indicates the social networks of these NYS users, and the cyber space captures the larger conversational context of the vaccination debate. Our results suggest that the Covid-19 vaccine debate is not polarized across all three spaces as compared to that of other vaccines. However, the rate of users with a pro-vaccine stance decreases from physical to relational and cyber spaces. We also found that while users from different spaces interact with each other, they also engage in local communications with users from the same region or same space, and distance-based and boundary-confined clusters exist in cyber and relational space communities. These results based on theSplatialframework not only shed light on the vaccination debates but also help to define and elucidate the relationships between the three spaces. The intense interactions between spaces suggest incorporating people’s relational network and cyber presence in physical place-making.',\n",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-vaxxers have used social media to distribute fake news and anxiety-provoking information about the vaccine. Such social media practice may harm the public. Here, we characterise the psycho-linguistic features of anti-vaxxers on the online social network Twitter. For this, we collected COVID-19 related tweets from February 2020 to June 2021 to analyse vaccination stance, linguistic features, and social network characteristics. Our results demonstrated that, compared to pro-vaxxers, anti-vaxxers tend to have more negative emotions, narrative thinking, and immoral tendencies. Furthermore, we found a tighter network structure in anti-vaxxers even after mass vaccination.

In addition to wearing masks, increasing sanitation, and avoiding crowds, widespread vaccination is crucial for preventing virus transmission. Despite significant progress in vaccine research and policy implementations, widespread immunization remains challenging. Analysis of exchanges on social media regarding COVID-19 vaccines has revealed significant uncertainty and mistrust in vaccines. As a result, ongoing evaluation of trust and confidence in COVID-19 vaccines is critical to crafting successful communication approaches for promoting extensive vaccination. This study aims to use content analysis of tweets about COVID-19 vaccines while also examining the user accounts generating them to provide evidence of fluctuations in public views toward COVID-19 vaccines. The proposed framework collects and processes data from social media networks, particularly Twitter, before presenting various analytics based on the different analyses performed through machine learning and deep learning algorithms. We hypothesize that a qualitative study starting from the pandemic would identify themes in public discourses (particularly those with negative sentiment or evidence of misleading information) that circulated during the developmental and mass release phases of COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, it could inform and aid healthcare officials, public health agencies, and policymakers in increasing awareness and educational interventions for COVID-19 vaccines.',\n",

We find the percentage of women in both hoarding and anti-hoarding groups is higher than that of the general Twitter user population. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we investigate the opinions expressed towards the hoarding behavior by categorizing these topics according to demographic and geographic groups. We also calculate the anxiety scores for the hoarding and anti-hoarding related tweets using a lexical approach.

In this paper, we analyze: (i) how inherent vaccine stances subtly influence individuals' selection of news sources and participation in social media discussions; and (ii) the impact of exposure to PBN on users' attitudes toward vaccines. In doing so, we first curate a comprehensive dataset that connects PBN with related social media discourse. Utilizing advanced deep learning and causal inference techniques, we reveal distinct user behaviors between social media groups with various vaccine stances.

The experiment results show that BERTopic improves coherence scores by 17.07% to 54.20% when compared to traditional approaches such as Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), prevalent in earlier political science research. Additionally, our results indicate topic metrics outperform sentiment metrics in stance classification, increasing performance by as much as 18.95%. Our findings suggest topic metrics are especially effective for context-rich texts and corpus where stance and sentiment correlations are weak.

During past pandemics, media were criticized for the sensationalized coverage of H1N1 and politicized coverage of both Ebola and Zika virus. Recent studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that media coverage of the health crisis may have affected the emotional states (i.e., panic, fear, anger) of the viewers and influenced the risk perception and protective actions such as hand washing, vaccination, maintaining social distancing and preference of mask-wearing. In this study, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of the New York Times (NYT) coverage of COVID-19-related stories published between 1, 2020, and August 31, 2022. Based on crisis communication and media framing theories, we analyzed the coverage span, size, and wording of the articles. Based on our sample, we observed that the frequency of COVID-19-related reports was higher at the beginning of the pandemic and decreased over time. Section analysis of the articles reflected a high diversity as coronavirus-related stories were distributed in more than ten sections. In addition, we found that almost 16 percent of the articles were placed in U.S. news and 14 percent were in the editorial. It also indicated a national interest and the topic's significance as articles found in editorials received more attention. Regarding media framing, in particular, the human interest, conflict, and economic consequences frame seem to cover more stories related to health determinants.

However, the best precision value of 0.80 was achieved using SVM with unigram and NB with bigram TF‐IDF. However, the Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) model outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 0.95, a precision of 0.96, a recall of 0.95, and anF1 score of 0.95. This model will help in gaining a complete idea of how receptive people are to the vaccine. Thus, the government will be able to find new ways and run more campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of the vaccine.',\n",
       " \"This comprehensive study analyzes the role of social media, specifically Facebook, in crisis communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conducted through a longitudinal netnography approach, the research scrutinizes the communication strategies of Australian public health agencies from 2019 to 2020 and their impact on shared situational awareness (SSA). Drawing on the Seppänen et al. (2013) model for crisis communication, the study looks at three key aspects - link content (information), link type (communication), and link quality (trust) - and evaluates how they influence SSA during a crisis. The application of Chaos Theory further enhances the research's depth by identifying patterns and transformations in Facebook communications before and after the COVID-19 disruption. The study reveals that the pandemic significantly disrupted typical health communication strategies, leading to new emergent patterns, and it also underscores the critical role of secondary communication and emotional factors in the public's decision to share crisis information. Moreover, it identifies issues such as misinformation and inconsistency in messaging as significant obstacles to the public's trust in official health communications, ultimately impeding the creation of adequate SSA. The research emphasizes the need to develop consistent, clear, and reliable messaging strategies for effective crisis communication. The findings expand existing knowledge on social media utilization in crisis communication, offering valuable insights to enhance public health agencies' communication strategies, thereby aiding in the creation of trusted SSA. Unlike prior studies focusing on crisis response teams, this research concentrates on shared situational awareness among the general public, providing practical recommendations to improve social media crisis communication for more effective response and management in a health crisis.\",\n",
       " 'Background HPV vaccination rate is low in China. Understanding the multidimensional barriers and impetuses perceived by individuals to vaccination is essential. We aim to assess the public perceptions, perceived barriers, and facilitators towards HPV vaccination expressed on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Methods We collected Weibo posts regarding HPV vaccines between 2018 to 2023. We annotated 6,600 posts manually according to behavior change theories, and subsequently fine-tuned deep learning models to annotate all posts collected. Based on the annotated results of deep learning models, temporal and geographic analyses were conducted for public attitudes towards HPV vaccination and its determinants. Findings Totally 1,972,495 Weibo posts were identified as relevant to HPV vaccines. Deep learning models reached predictive accuracy of 0.78 to 0.96 in classifying posts. During 2018 to 2023, 1,314,510 (66.6%) posts were classified as positive attitudes. And 224,130 posts (11.4%) were classified as misinformation, 328,442 posts (16.7%) as perceived barriers to accepting vaccines, and 580,590 posts (29.4%) as practical barriers to vaccination. The prevalence of positive attitude increased from 15.8% in March 2018 to 79.1% in mid-2023 (p < 0.001), and misinformation declined from 36.6% in mid-2018 to 10.7% in mid-2023 (P < .001). Central regions exhibited higher prevalence of positive attitudes and social norms, whereas Shanghai, Beijing megacities and northeastern regions showed higher prevalence of negative attitudes and misinformation. Positive attitudes were significantly lower for 2-valent vaccines (65.7%), than 4-valent or 9-valent vaccines (79.6% and 74.1%).  Interpretation Social media listening represents a promising surveillance approach for monitoring public perceptions on health issues and can enable the development of health communication strategies.',\n",

       " 'This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the social media posts of prefectural governors in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. It investigates the correlation between social media activity levels, governors’ characteristics, and engagement metrics. To predict citizen engagement of a specific tweet, machine learning models (MLMs) are trained using three feature sets. The first set includes variables representing profile- and tweet-related features. The second set incorporates word embeddings from three popular models, while the third set combines the first set with one of the embeddings. Additionally, seven classifiers are employed. The best-performing model utilizes the first feature set with FastText embedding and the XGBoost classifier. This study aims to collect governors’ COVID-19-related tweets, analyze engagement metrics, investigate correlations with governors’ characteristics, examine tweet-related features, and train MLMs for prediction. This paper’s main contributions are twofold. Firstly, it offers an analysis of social media engagement by prefectural governors during the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding light on their communication strategies and citizen engagement outcomes. Secondly, it explores the effectiveness of MLMs and word embeddings in predicting tweet engagement, providing practical implications for policymakers in crisis communication. The findings emphasize the importance of social media engagement for effective governance and provide insights into factors influencing citizen engagement.',\n",

The main challenge of visual-textual sentiment analysis is how to learn effective visual features for sentiment prediction since input images are often very diverse. To address this challenge, we propose a new method that improves visual-textual sentiment analysis by introducing powerful expert visual features. The proposed method consists of four parts: (1) a visual-textual branch to learn features directly from data for sentiment analysis, (2) a visual expert branch with a set of pre-trained \"expert\" encoders to extract effective visual features, (3) a CLIP branch to implicitly model visual-textual correspondence, and (4) a multimodal feature fusion network based on either BERT or MLP to fuse multimodal features and make sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our method produces better visual-textual sentiment analysis performance than existing methods.',\n",

This paper constructs a news-based index to measure public sentiment regarding the progress of COVID-19 vaccine development during the first year of the outbreak and examines its impact on international financial markets. We find that positive vaccine development sentiment decreases the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) while boosting capital inflows and currency appreciation in emerging markets, as vaccine development leads to a greater reduction in public expectations of future risk in these markets. It also lowers the unit price of risk in the context of carry trade risk premiums, as favorable developments reduce expected future economic uncertainty.',\n",

The collected Tweets were pre-processed to prepare them for analysis by (1) removing non-English language tweets, retweets, emojis, emoticons, non-printable characters, the punctuation marks, and the prepositions, (2) anonymizing the identity of the users, and (3) normalizing various forms of the same words. We used the state-of-the-art BertTopic modeling library to identify the most popular topics.ResultsOf 165,048 Tweets collected, 36,908 Tweets were analyzed in this study. From these tweets, we identified 9 topics, which were about Biden administration, Pfizer & BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, eligibility for booster shots, side effects, Donald Trump, variants of the Novel Coronavirus, and conspiracy theory & propaganda. The mean of sentiment was positive in all topics. The lowest and highest mean of sentiments were for the Donald Trump topic (0.0097) and the Johnson & Johnson topic (0.1294), respectively.ConclusionsThe topics identified in this study not only accurately reflect the contemporary COVID-19 discussion, but also the high degree of politicization in the USA. While the latter might be a result of our rejection of non-English tweets, it is reassuring to see our fully automated, unsupervised pipeline reliably extract such global features in the data at scale. We, therefore, believe that the methodology presented in this study is mature and useful for other infoveillance studies on a wide variety of topics.',\n",
       " 'We assessed the perceived risks of COVID vaccines using a Health Belief Model (HBM) among the American public during the vaccination roll-out in the USA. We employed a retrospective study of 1,149 adults from the 2020 American National Election Studies surveys to assess the public’s belief about the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic. The logistic regression analysis found several predictors of perceived health risks of the COVID vaccine. For urban/suburban residents, having higher education, being older, being White, and having higher income emerged as protective factors. People with these characteristics are less likely to perceive the COVID vaccine as risky. Also, higher use of Twitter emerged as a protective factor for residents from urban/suburban regions. However, residents from rural/small towns who use Facebook often are more likely to perceive the COVID vaccine as risky. Perceived risks of vaccination are high among Facebook users of residents from rural/small towns and low among Twitter users among residents from urban/suburban areas. The authors identified several protective factors: being educated, older, economically well-off, and White. The authors propose interventions to reduce perceived risks and vaccine hesitancy among vulnerable populations.',\n",

Our findings reveal that LSTM, particularly when combined with tweet text tokenization, stands out as the most effective approach. Furthermore, the study highlights the pivotal role of feature selection, showcasing how TF-IDF features significantly bolster the performance of SVM and LSTM, achieving an impressive accuracy exceeding 98%.

For many natural systems, this information is the result of millions, if not billions, of years of evolution, and the structures which contain them are not simple, even if we decompose them in elementary parts we cannot predict the collective phenomena which arise from their interplay. These systems are complex. Complex systems are rooted in almost every aspect of life, and social science has offered in the last years ample possibilities for computational applications. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that many of the systems on which the health, wealth, and security of our society depend are neither purely social nor purely computational. They are socio-technical systems. Workplace relationships, economic trade, media markets, health delivery systems, or even criminal justice organizations are all increasingly characterized by a complex mixture of human actors and institutions on the one hand, or digital platforms and algorithms on the other hand. For example, on Twitter every kind of interaction must follow some ground rules, there are specific types of engagement and also content sharing is governed by preferential logic implemented by an algorithm whose development we are not even familiar with. So the human aspect is embedded in a technical plot of guidelines. The Twitter platform is a very recent example, but throughout history, we can identify many instances where human interactions have been mixed with technical rules, just think of all commercial exchange relationships, where bureaucracy is a key component of relationships that are nonetheless the sum of multiple interactions between physical individuals.

Second, I have investigated the spatial pattern of COVID-19 in the USA and its associations with Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) by utilizing the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHRR) dataset. Finally, I analyzed how news media reporting of key health determinants (ie, age, race, income and gender) is framed, including the role of different stakeholders in the context of COVID-19. Findings revealed a statistical relationship between CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and Mississippi's county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths. I also found that COVID-19 infections showed considerable spatial heterogeneity as the distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths varies across the US counties and among the three largest waves. The multiple regression results also exhibited a temporal association between social determinants of health (SDH) indicators and COVID-19-related health outcomes across the USA.

In this work, opinion mining of tweets posted by users in Twitter regarding corona vaccination has been performed using Machine Learning Models and Lexicon based approach. Data are collected from Twitter through Tweepy API, and it is pre-processed using NLTK library using python. A comparison of eleven different classification algorithms is made to determine which the best is. As a result, we can conclude that people support neutral decision to take Corona vaccine during the current pandemic.',\n",

       " \"From democratic states to autocratic regimes, citizens have often resorted to mass protest as a channel to express their discontent about the repugnant acts of their governments. The unified voice of these protestors has sometimes been the crux for instigating change. In August 2021, the citizens of Ghana took to the streets in what became the genesis of a national movement labelled'Fix The Country.'The movement, meant to be politically-neutral, was aimed at calling the Ghanaian government to kickstart a social, political, and economic reform. Twitter, a microblogging site, helped fuel the protest, as citizens utilized the hashtag# FixTheCountry to express their thought about the protest. This study, which is corpus-based, retrieved 10,000 tweets to investigate how the movement transpired via Twitter and its implication for Ghana's Democracy and overall development. By performing word cloud and sentiment analysis, the study reveals that Twitter was utilized by protestors as a potent tool for amplifying their thoughts to their political elites; it was also deployed as a medium for mobilizing street protests and also for soliciting funds to push forward the movement. However, the study further argues that the endemic of political polarization propelled the Ghanaian Twittersphere to tag the movement on political lines. In light of this, the study postulates that the act of political polarization corrodes the movement, which could explain why it is struggling to inspire the anticipated change. The study recommends that the citizens should utilize Twitter as a tool to collectively call for change instead of deploying it to exacerbate political polarization, a phenomenon that undermines Democracy and attenuates people's power of resistance.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccine hesitancy was found to be one of the top ten global health threats in 2019 by World Health Organization. Worldwide, more than 90% of countries have encountered vaccine hesitancy, which has notably jeopardized the implementation of vaccination campaigns. Some of the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy can be lack of confidence in information or lack of adequate information about the vaccine, misinformation from social media, and a fear of side effects. Widespread acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is extremely crucial in order to achieve sufficient immunization coverage to end this global pandemic. It is evident that the number of studies that have investigated COVID-19 vaccination attitudes in lower-income countries like India is quite low. We analyze COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy in Indian Scenario using the Twitter social media platform to ensure that these vaccines reach even the remotest of places, whether rural or urban, in India, while observing the results and outcomes of our research. We aim for accurate results and hope to help the Indian government in the process of making informed decisions for the vaccine-hesitant groups of India.',\n",

       " \"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started in Wuhan, China and has since spread to all continents of the world. In Nigeria, the virus was first detected in Lagos when an Italian tested positive for it. In attempts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, various vaccines have been developed to reduce the virus's presence in human population. This paper relied on secondary data and existing literatures to critically examine factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake among Nigerians. Findings established that most Nigerians (66.2%) were found to be willing to take a potential COVID-19 vaccine if recommended by health workers. Similarly, the paper explains that certain variables such as sex (male gender), religion, ethnicity, and geographical location positively influence the willingness of Nigerians to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The paper concludes that the acceptance and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination among Nigeria is rooted in rationality as decisions of Nigerians about whether or not to accept and take the vaccine are calculated in terms of gaining potential pleasure from taking the vaccine and avoiding potential harmful effects of not taking the vaccine.\",\n",

This study examines sentiment trends in tweets before and after the vaccination rollout, focusing on the sentiment in India. The analysis spans from January 2020 to January 2022, with a particular emphasis on the sentiment count and the shift in sentiments following the vaccination start. The methodology involves data collection using the Twitter Streaming API, data pre-processing to clean and label the tweets, and the creation of a time series to track sentiment changes over time. The sentiment analysis model, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) for feature extraction and a Bi-LSTM model for classification, achieves high accuracies of 98.2% and 96.6% for training and testing, respectively, before vaccination, and 97.7% and 96.1% after vaccination. The results indicate a notable increase in positive sentiments postvaccination, reflecting a favorable public response and a stabilization in public opinion.',\n",

Since very few studies examine the relationship between online sentiment and the number of local COVID-19 confirmed cases, in this study, we aim to bridge this gap. Choosing California as the location for the estimation, we collected public posts that used COVID-19 and California-related keywords from 25 January 2020 to 20 December 2020 from Facebook and evaluated the sentiments expressed in the responses. Using the Granger Causality Test, we estimated the relation of online sentiment and post reactions to the number of daily confirmed cases in California.

To investigate the mental impact of COVID-19 and to respond to the call of researchers for the use of unobtrusive and intensive measurement in capturing time-sensitive psychological concepts (e.g., affect), we used big data methods to investigate the impact of COVID-19 by analyzing 348,933 tweets that people posted from April 1, 2020 to April 24, 2020. The dataset covers 2,231 working adults, who are from 454 counties across 48 states in the United States. In this study, we theorize the similarity and dissimilarity between COVID-19 and other common stressors. Similar to other stressors, pandemic severity negatively influenced the well-being of people by increasing negative affect. However, we did not find an influence of pandemic severity on the positive affect of the people. Dissimilar to other stressors, the protective factors for people during COVID-19 are not common factors that make people resilient to stress and they echo the unique experience during COVID-19. Moreover, we analyzed the text content of 348,933 tweets through Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) and word cloud analysis to further reveal the psychological impact of COVID-19 and why the protective factors make people resilient to the mental impact of COVID-19. These exploratory analyses revealed the specific emotions that people experienced and the topics that people are concerned about during the pandemic.

Personality was assessed in January/February 2020 when the public was not aware of the spread of coronavirus in the USA. Participants were reassessed in late March 2020 with four sets of questions about the pandemic: concerns, precautions, preparatory behaviours, and duration estimates. The sample consisted ofN=\\u20092066 participants (mean age\\u2009=\\u200951.42; range\\u2009=\\u200918–98; 48.5% women). Regression models were used to analyse the data with age, gender, education, race, and ethnicity as covariates. Consistent with the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was related to more concerns and longer duration estimates related to COVID-19, higher extraversion was related to shorter duration estimates, and higher conscientiousness was associated with more precautions. In contrast to the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was associated with fewer precautions and unrelated to preparatory behaviours. Age moderated several trait-response associations, suggesting that some of the responses were associated more strongly in older adults, a group at risk for complications of COVID-19. For example, older adults high in conscientiousness prepared more. The present findings provide insights into how personality predicts concerns and behaviours related to the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the nature of care itself and the new ways of working are potentially very stressful. We aim to analyze the resilience of care nurses to the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a systematic review of nurse caregiver resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Our search was conducted in the WOS, Medline/PubMed, Cochrane, BVS/LILACS, and Cuiden databases. The inclusion criteria were: studies published in Spanish or English; carried out from March 2020 to May 2021 on nurses caring for patients with COVID-19; and investigating the factors influencing the psychological impact, resilience, strategies to develop it, and interventions to promote it during this pandemic and others, such as SARS, MERS, or ebola. The quality of the studies and the risk of bias were evaluated following ICROMS, STROBE and AMSTAR-2 criteria. Twenty-two studies were selected. Most of the studies highlighted the presence of stressors in nurses, emphasizing those of the environment, which converged in dysfunctional responses that hurt their resilience. The most persuasive factors were social and organizational support. Coping strategies developed by nurses and especially interventions by organizations were detected as instruments to foster resilience, but have not been well researched. Resilience has a key moderating role in mitigating the psychological impact of nurses in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

       " 'Although the COVID-19 crisis is a worldwide threat to individuals’ physical health and psychological well-being, not all people are equally susceptible to increased ill-being. One potentially important factor in individuals’ vulnerability (versus resilience) to ill-being in the face of stress is emotion regulation. On the basis of Self-Determination Theory, this study examined the role of three emotion regulation styles in individuals’ mental health during the COVID-19 crisis, that is, integration, suppression, and dysregulation. Participants were 6584 adults (77% female,Mage=\\u200945.16\\xa0years) who filled out well-validated measures of emotion regulation, depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, and sleep quality. To examine naturally occurring combinations of emotion regulation strategies, hierarchical k-means clustering was performed, yielding 3 profiles: (a) low scores on all strategies (indicating rather low overall levels of worry; 27%), (b) high scores on integration only (41%), and (c) high scores on suppression and dysregulation (32%). Participants in the profiles scoring high on suppression and dysregulation displayed a less favorable pattern of outcomes (high ill-being, low life satisfaction, and poorer sleep quality) compared to the other two groups. Between-cluster differences remained significant even when taking into account the corona-related worries experienced by people. Overall, the findings underscore the important role of emotion regulation in individuals’ mental health during mentally challenging periods such as the COVID-19 crisis. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.',\n",
       " 'The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the constructs proposed by two influential theoretical frameworks: the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Big Five (B5) model of personality in predicting health-related coping behavior during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Both adaptive (i.e., preventive) and maladaptive (i.e., avoidant behavior and wishful thinking) coping behavior was measured. The study was conducted during the first wave of the pandemic. The sample consisted of 397 persons from the general Polish population. The findings provided strong support for the PMT constructs’ predictive value, especially with regard to pandemic-related adaptive behavior. The B5 personality traits accounted for a small proportion of the variability of coping behavior, especially when maladaptive behavior was the outcome. The PMT model showed incremental validity over and above demographic variables and personality traits in predicting preventive behavior, avoidant behavior, and wishful thinking; however, the patterns of relationships differ across the types of coping behavior. According to the current results, to increase adherence to preventive measures during an epidemic, all the PMT constructs should be considered while persuasive communication to the public is formulated.',\n",
       " 'The current study used Family Systems Theory as a framework to clarify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual, romantic, and individual functioning. Specifically, sexual and romantic functioning were modeled as key mechanisms linking COVID-19 related stressors (as predictors) to aspects of individual functioning over time (as outcomes). A sample of 1,241 sexually active adults in relationships (47% married/engaged) was recruited from March 5 to May 5, 2020: 82% White, 66% women, M\\u2009=\\u200934 years old, 58% heterosexual. All participants completed a baseline survey and 642 participants completed at least one of the six, monthly, follow-up surveys. Multilevel SEM models evaluated the model both at the level of stable between-person differences (i.e., level 2) and at the level of within-person change across time (i.e., level 1). The findings suggested that COVID-19 related stress was predictive of lower sexual, romantic, and individual functioning in both levels of the model. Significant indirect paths supported the proposed mediation at the level of within-person change across time: elevations in COVID-19 stress within specific months predicted corresponding drops in sexual functioning, which in turn predicted corresponding drops in romantic functioning, which in turn predicted corresponding drops in individual well-being (highlighting points of intervention). In contrast, at the level of between-person differences, stable levels of sexual and relationship satisfaction across the 6\\xa0months of the study were not associated with stable levels of COVID-19 stressors (representing sources of resilience that promoted well-being) and stable levels of stress from social isolation predicted stably higher amounts of communicating affection to one’s loved ones (suggesting a need for affiliation in the face of chronic stress) whereas stable difficulties with orgasms were linked to stable irritability toward partners and depressive symptoms. Multigroup analyses suggested that the findings generalized across gender, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, relationship stage, and cohabitation groups. Spillover effects within a Family Systems Theory framework clarify how upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic could have impacted sexual, romantic, and individual functioning in a process-oriented framework, highlighting sources of resilience (sexual satisfaction, communicating affection) and risk (orgasm difficulties).',\n",

We evaluated the contribution of personal, work, and COVID-19 variables in three burnout subclasses: personal, work, and patient-related. A cross-sectional, exploratory, and quantitative design was employed and participants were sampled using convenience and snowball technique. An online survey was conducted and 153 nurses participated in our study. Socio-demographic characterization was conducted, levels of burnout and determinants were explored through multiple linear regression models for its three dimensions. High levels of personal, working, and patient burnout were present in 71 (46%), 68 (44%), and 33 nurses (22%), respectively. Most of them agreed that COVID-19 had an impact on their activities. Significant personal and work related burnout factors found were specialization in palliative care, self-perceived health status, unit type, weekly hours of work, and allocation to COVID-19 units. Gender was found to be a significant factor in patient-related burnout. There is a high level of burnout among nurses working in the Portuguese national network of palliative care. Measures for identification and mitigation of burnout are necessary to protect health care professionals.',\n",

Parents’ stress and parental couple conflict have been linked to children’s adverse developmental outcomes. However, little is known about the factors that affect parents’ well-being when coping with multiple stressors such as those brought by the recent COVID-19 global pandemic. Our study intended to examine the predictors of parental well-being by looking at the contextual factors of COVID-19 home confinement, i.e., the use of digital media and parents’ domestic workload, and family resilience in two countries: Ireland and Italy. Additionally, the age and number of children were controlled as potential variables impacting parents’ well-being. A three-step hierarchical regression analysis was applied. The results showed that family resilience was a very strong predictor of parents’ well-being after controlling for any other variable. Parental couples’ conflict over the use of technology predicted lower levels of parents’ well-being, while, notably, parent child-conflict and domestic workload were not associated with parents’ well-being. Additionally, the age of children did play a role: the higher the mean age of children in the family the better the parents’ well-being.

Nurses are under great stress when caring for critically ill patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the perceived stress and coping behaviors of nurses caring for critically ill patients with COVID-19 using a mixed-methods approach. We recruited 85 nurses from a special intensive care unit (ICU) of a medical center in Taiwan between May and June 2021. To gather data, we used a questionnaire on basic characteristics, the perceived stress scale (PSS-14), and the brief coping orientation to problems experienced inventory (B-COPE), then conducted a qualitative interview. The results showed that the average perceived stress level among nurses was 25.4 points, and most of them perceived moderate stress. The top three coping behaviors practiced by the nurses were active coping, planning, and acceptance. Nurses who received less perceived support from their friends or families and who had shorter working experience in nursing had significantly higher stress levels. The qualitative results revealed that the nurses’ perceived stress came from fear, worry, and the increased burden caused by caring for critical patients with COVID-19. Coping behaviors included rest, seeking support, and affirmative fighting. Based on these findings, it is suggested that the support nurses receive from their families is an important predictor of perceived stress. Therefore, it is suggested that nurses be provided with more support in dealing with stress caused by caring for critical patients with COVID-19 in special ICUs.',\n",

The moderating role of awareness of COVID-19 on the mediation model is also tested. This study employed a longitudinal correlation design with a three-wave data collection technique. The data were collected using a snowballing sampling technique where participants were recruited through online advertisements. Finally, 345 responses were included in the analysis after dropping participants who did not fully complete the study and failed the attention check items. The measures included fear of COVID-19, perceived stress, subjective well-being and awareness of COVID-19 and were administered using an online survey platform. The results suggested that fear of COVID-19 adversely impacted subjective well-being while perceived stress partially mediated the relationship. Additionally, awareness of COVID-19 moderated the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and perceived stress. The effect of fear of COVID-19 on perceived stress was more positive for those who had high awareness of COVID-19, consequently lowering subjective well-being.

       " 'Drawing upon perceived organizational support (POS) theory, this study examines the influence of the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention measures adopted by an organization on employees’ POS and work behaviors. We also consider the role of COVID-19 outbreak size in moderating such effects by pitting two theoretical views against one another. A discretion view suggests that when a COVID-19 outbreak is large, employees are likely to perceive a lack of discretion in their organization’s provision of prevention measures; therefore, offering more prevention measures will have a limited impact on employee POS and behaviors. In contrast, a supply-needs view suggests that employees’ need for protection increases as the size of the COVID-19 outbreak increases; therefore, organizations meet such needs by offering more prevention measures to employees to enhance their POS and work behaviors. By studying a sample of working adults in the United States (N=\\u2009320), we found that the number of prevention measures adopted by an organization positively influenced employees’ POS and, indirectly, work behaviors. In addition, we found an interaction effect to support the supply-needs view. Our findings provide insight and guidance to practitioners to allow the more effective adoption of COVID-19 prevention measures to support and manage employees.',\n",
       " 'This study integrates the job demands-resources model and authentic leadership theory to test the general hypothesis that authentic leadership is a job resource that enables flourishing and performance in healthcare teams. Furthermore, this article tests the hypothesis that the daily bed occupancy is a job demand that weakens this relationship. Participants were 106 nurses that were distributed across 33 teams from two hospitals. The results suggest that the authentic leadership of team leaders is positively related with subjective and objective team performance, but only when daily bed occupancy is low. Authentic leadership had no relationship with team flourishing, regardless of the daily bed occupancy. Our findings suggest that the extent to which authentic leadership is adequate to promote the performance of teams working in a hospital setting is sensitive to contextual boundary conditions. Leading authentically might only be effective under specific circumstances.',\n",
       " 'Background and Objectives:Moving nurses to a COVID-19 department may cause the phenomenon of transition shock, which occurs when already employed nurses change jobs. A set of confusing and uncertain feelings arise due to the unfamiliar work environment, which may lead to their intention to leave the nursing profession. The aim of this study was to examine transition shock and the contribution of both the respondents’ characteristics and the presence of stressors to the occurrence of transition shock in nurses assigned to work in COVID-19 departments.Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study with 120 nurses employed in COVID-19 departments was conducted. Several linear regression models were used to assess the association between transition shock, personal and professional COVID-19 stressors, and the intention to leave the nursing profession.Results: Nurses who intended to leave the profession showed higher transition shock and higher personal and professional stressors (p< 0.001). Female nurses had lower transition shock (β = −0.16;p= 0.036) and higher personal COVID-19 stressors (β = 0.27;p< 0.001). University education contributes to the lowering of nurses’ transition shock (β = −0.16;p= 0.038). Nurses who did not intend to leave the nursing profession had lower personal COVID-19 stressors (β = −0.15;p= 0.044). Transition shock was associated with personal COVID-19 stressors (β = 0.39;p< 0.001) and professional COVID-19 stressors (β = 0.29;p< 0.001), and vice versa.Conclusions: The phenomenon of transition shock was present after nurses transitioned to working in COVID-19 departments. Transition shock may cause more nurses to leave the profession, which may have a strong impact on the health system in many countries that are already facing a shortage of nurses. Additional education on and preparation for adapting to new working conditions with psychological support could have an influence by lowering the level of nurses’ transition shock.',\n",
       " 'The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze the personal, social and psychological impact of COVID −19 on the mental health of students of age group 16 to 25. A response from N= 351 students (from the most affected state in India), provided a comparative analysis based on the gender, and background via t-test with significance factor of p≤0.5, to understand the pattern in issues related to mental health during the pandemic. The results show that female students are more concerned about health, and future, and are more prone to psychological issues like feelings of uncertainty, helplessness and outbursts than male students. Urban student’s population is more mentally affected than their rural counterparts, however time spent on the internet is almost the same despite the difference in infrastructure and resources. Also, there is an increase in need for solitude, being withdrawn and self-harm in male students require attention. A shift in perception from seeing family as a source of support to that of a restriction is indicated, although the benefits of a collectivistic society are undisputed. The results indicate that there is overall increased awareness about mental health among the student population and with programs/strategies focusing on background and gender, a significant improvement is attainable.',\n",

(3) A total of 165 persons were evaluated, with 79 working in the COVID-19 department and 86 working in the non-COVID-19 department. No statistically significant differences were found in the perceived stress scores, emotional distress (functional or dysfunctional), and disease perception among the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. Also, we did not find any differences between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 departments concerning their total Maslach scores—50 in the COVID-19 department and 51 in the non-COVID-19 department,p= 0480—so a moderate level of burnout in the two groups. The only statistical difference was in the Maslach depersonalization scores, which were higher among COVID-19 workers (p= 0.024).

We propose that routines – behaviors that are performed regularly (activation) and in similar ways (execution) – can be used to describe underlying structures in Web use and, thereby, improve the predictability of subsequent Web use behavior. Based on two large-scale Web-tracking data sets, we developed indicators for routine activation and execution, tested their reliability and stability, and examined their association with the predictability of six Web use behaviors: overall Web use, news use, shopping, Facebook, YouTube, and Google use. Our results show that routine measures derived from tracking data were only moderately reliable but very stable. Routine activation was consistently and substantially associated with higher predictability for all Web use behaviors, whereas routine execution was less consistently and not strongly linked to predictability.',\n",
       " 'Nursing has always been a stressful job affecting the physical and mental health of the nurses, but the new medical context of the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced this issue. The objective of this paper is to study differences between non-employed and employed nursing students in the medical system of Romania before and during the epidemic using matching methods and a sample of 526 nursing students. Stressors and strategies for coping with stress were also identified during the pandemic. The results indicated that employed students were more vulnerable to stress compared to non-employed ones before and during the pandemic. Females registered significantly higher stress scores compared to males in the period of the epidemic. The analysis of the overall sample suggested that gender and environment were significant stress factors during the pandemic, but living conditions were not relevant. The most effective coping strategies against stress for nurses during the COVID-19 crisis were based on self-control and the spiritual dimension, unlike the previous period when other colleagues’ support helped most nurses to overcome difficult working conditions. The implications of this study might help medical management in ensuring a less stressful environment for nurses during the epidemic.',\n",

The current study aimed to investigate how meaning in life contributed to the Chinese general public’s acquisition of COVID-19-related health behavior habits, and whether health values would play a mediating role and conscientiousness would play a further moderating role in this relation. A total of 1024 Chinese participants (age range\\u2009=\\u200917–63 years; 67.29% females) were recruited by posting flyers on an open-access web forum. All participants voluntarily completed a series of online anonymous questionnaires assessing conscientiousness, meaning in life, health values and health behavior habits. Results showed that (1) the majority of the respondents reported the acquisition of COVID-19-related health behavior habits, and meaning in life positively predicted COVID-19-related health behavior habits; (2) health values mediated the link between meaning in life and health behavior habits; and (3) conscientiousness moderated the indirect effect, such that the indirect effect was stronger among individuals with low conscientiousness. These findings have important implications for revealing the reconstruction of the Chinese public’s health behavior habits and its potential mechanism that meaning in life influences health behavior habits through health values during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for individuals with low conscientiousness.',\n",

Individual differences only predicted government compliance in autocratic countries and in countries with income inequality.

The questionnaire included: (i) The measures of health-related quality of life to perform the Summary Index of Unhealthy Days, (ii) modified items from the “Standard questionnaire on risk perception of an infectious disease outbreak” and (iii) the items of the General Health Questionnaire.ResultsOne hundred and thirty professionals out of 130 participated in the first interview, while only 50 therapists took part in the second interview (dropout rate: 61%). The Summary Index of Unhealthy Days was 8 days at the first interview, and it decreased to 6 days at the second interview; however, the reduction was not significant (F = 3.22;p= 0.079). The multivariable analysis showed that the rehabilitation providers with moderate or severe stress level were more likely to have a negative perception of the quality of life (ORadj = 7.155; 95% CI: 2.8–18.2), and this result was confirmed at the second interview.ConclusionsOur results showed that in a severe public health emergency, the mental health and quality of life of rehabilitation professionals must be a topic of focus to enhance psychological resilience, to prevent burnout and to reduce rehabilitation errors.',\n",

       " 'Students in higher education institutions (HEIs) develop perceived value related to their academic services. While many studies have suggested some antecedents of perceived values, the interactions between fairness, quality of services, and the context in which the service occurs still received less attention. This study aims to investigate the effect of university organisational justice on students’ perceived value via the mediating role of service quality, in which the relationships are moderated by the students’ awareness of the COVID-19 situation in Higher Education Institutions (HEI). The data were collected from students enrolled in three public universities in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The students completed a three-wave data collection procedure with an online survey in each wave. After removing incomplete and careless responses, 517 data were included in the analysis. This study found that the effect of perceived university organisational justice on perceived value was mediated by service quality. Students’ awareness of COVID-19 moderated the indirect positive effect of university organisational justice on perceived value via service quality. This mediating mechanism was stronger as the students were aware of COVID-19. Although perceived fairness in academic services positively contributed to perceived value in the universities, students’ awareness of COVID-19 could improve how they perceive university organisational justice, service quality, and value in academic services. HEIs must actively inform their students about the service process and progress, particularly during a crisis. They must thoroughly introduce the adjustments during a crisis and anticipate some disadvantages to their students.',\n",
       " 'Planfulnessrefers to an individual’s tendency to be future oriented, mentally flexible, and cognitively strategic when engaging with goals, and has been shown to predict goal completion. We investigated the relationships among planfulness, goal disruption, stress, and psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, which served as a unique setback context. We measured these constructs using the planfulness scale, anad-hocsurvey item probing goal disruption in the pandemic, the perceived stress scale, and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, respectively. Participants were university students (N=\\u2009174; mean age 23.03, SD: 4.37; 77% female). Higher planfulness predicted lower goal-disruption, lower stress, and higher well-being during the pandemic, extending its benefits beyond the goal domain. High levels of planfulness did not protect against goal disruption among those participants in which the self-reported personal impact of the pandemic was highest. Differences in goal disruption across levels of planfulness were constrained to lower reported pandemic impact. However, the differences in psychological well-being and stress by levels of planfulness were retained even when self-reported perceptions of personal pandemic impact were high. More planful students maintained lower stress and higher psychological well-being than their less planful peers across levels of adversity. These findings suggest that even in extremely difficult contexts in which planfulness does not protect against goal disruption, it still confers personal benefits in terms of psychological health.',\n",
       " \"Chronic stress risks an individual's overall well-being. Chronic stress is associated with allostatic load, the body's wear-and-tear due to prolonged heightened physiological and psychological states. Increased allostatic load among workers increases their risk of injuries and the likelihood of diseases and illnesses. An allostatic load model could explain the basis of a stress response. Stress research in affective computing uses wearable devices, data processing algorithms, and machine learning methods to create models that could benefit from an allostatic load model of stress. We emphasize the need for the allostatic load model in affective computing to create disease and illness prediction models. Predictive models could enhance safeguards in the workplace by helping to create proactive mitigation strategies against chronic stress. First, we briefly introduce allostasis’ physiological and psychological basis. Next, we reviewed stress studies within affective computing that may benefit from an allostatic load model of stress. We focused our review on studies conducted in dynamic settings, such as the workplace, and those incorporating typical stress study elements in affective computing. We conclude our review by identifying gaps between affective computing and neuroscientific stress studies and provide recommendations for adopting the allostatic load model of stress.\",\n",

The current quantitative, cross-sectional, correlational study investigated how personality traits impact the relationship between psychological distress and posttraumatic growth (PTG) arising from COVID-19 experience in the U.S.A. It was hypothesised that (1) trait openness would moderate the relationship between psychological distress and PTG, such that it would be stronger at high openness; and (2) trait neuroticism would moderate the relationship between psychological distress and PTG, such that it would be weaker at high neuroticism. Using CloudResearch, 294 adults (59.5% women) aged between 18 and 74 (M=\\xa039.4;SD=\\xa015.8) completed a survey comprising the Big Five Inventory 2 – Short Form (BFI-2-S), Impact of Events Scale – Revised (IES-R), and Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) scales. Moderated multiple regressions indicated significant interactive relationships between psychological distress, personality, and posttraumatic growth, whilst accounting for age, gender, and ethnicity. At low distress, those with high openness showed higher growth (b=\\xa00.86,p\\xa0<.001), whilst at high traumatic impact, highly open participants reported lower growth. Higher growth was noted at lower neuroticism (b=\\xa01.02,p\\xa0<.001), although the level of growth differed depending on distress intensity. The present findings differ from previous literature, providing insight into the complex structure of PTG as influenced by personality and COVID-19-related distress. Whilst it is possible the current study reflects peri-traumatic growth, given the ongoing COVID-19 experience, the findings offer potential avenues for improving psychological wellbeing for the wider population.',\n",

For data collection, semi-structured interviews were utilized in a theoretical sample of frontline nurses who worked in public hospitals of Extremadura and Madrid, Spain, until saturation of data. The interviews were conducted between the months of May and December 2020 following an outline of topics. The analysis was based on the phenomenological focus of Giorgi and was supported by the software Atlas-Ti 8.0.ResultsA total of 14 nurses participated in this study. Two main themes emerged to explain the perceptions of the nurses: (1) the professional commitment of the nurses during the pandemic and (2) the effects of the pandemic on professional development; seven subcategories were also identified.ConclusionThe social and professional development of nurses is important. If nurses feel that they are quality professionals, this will enable them to protect their psychosocial health and increase professional commitment toward their patients in difficult situations such as pandemics. The results of this study may serve as a guide for better understanding the problems and needs of nurses as healthcare providers. This may help administrators in the generation of solutions for the establishment of a safe and reliable work environment, which will in turn promote a healthcare system that can efficiently respond to future catastrophes.',\n",
       " 'The pandemic situation of COVID-19 has introduced new challenges on family routines, affecting interpersonal relationships, which may have detrimental consequences to child well-being. The current study aimed to examine the direct effects of marital adjustment on child socioemotional adjustment and to test if parental self-efficacy mediated this association during home confinement due to COVID-19. A final sample of 163 caregivers was recruited online during home confinement period. On average children were 6 years-old (SD= 2.92; 44.8% girls). Caregivers and their child were in home confinement for an average of 31 days (SD= 12.08). Most of the couples had been married or living together for an average of 14 years (SD= 5.77) and had a university degree, mostly living in metropolitan areas. Caregivers answer to a set of measures assessing marital adjustment, parental self-efficacy, and child socioemotional competence and behavior. Findings depicted a direct effect on the positive association between marital satisfaction and parental self-efficacy, and negatively associated with anger-aggression. Parental self-efficacy was positively associated with child’s: social competence, negatively associated with anger-aggression, and anxiety-withdrawal. Indirect effects depicted that marital satisfaction was associated with child’s social competence, anger-aggression and anxiety-withdrawal through parental self-efficacy. Thus, higher marital satisfaction was associated with more parental self-efficacy which in turn was associated with more child’s social competence. Findings are relevant to the current state of the art, given the lack of information regarding imposed isolation due to COVID-19 and the consequences it may have to child’s well-being.',\n",
       " '(1)Background: Stress is defined as a psychological sensation related to a change in both human physiology and behavior in response to a threat or challenge. As the prevalence of stress is increasing globally, nurses represent a risk group for exposure to stress-related psychological alterations. The aim of this study was to explore how clinical nurses in Lithuania cope with the perceived chronic stress in relation to additional emotional experiences following the death of a patient. (2)Methods: During a four-week period of October 2023, a total of 283 female nurses, aged between 20 and 70 years old, were enrolled in a single cross-sectional study. The PSS-10 (perceived stress scale) and the Brief-COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) questionnaires were applied to assess the level of self-perceived stress and the use of coping styles along with the adequate strategies. Furthermore, the nurses’ emotions, evoked following patient death, were classified depending on their valence. Both the multiple linear and logistic regression statistical analyses were conducted to examine the associations between dependent and independent variables. (3)Results: The study identified that more than half of the nurses experienced patient death several times a month. A moderate-to-high level of the symptoms of mental chronic stress were suffered by 76% of caregivers. The psychological arousal following the death of a patient may induce the occurrence of emotional complexity that refers to competitive feelings, namely, helplessness (adjusted odd ratio (AOR) 1.7, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1; 2.9), disappointment (AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1; 3.5), anxiety (AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2; 4.2), and guilt (ORadj4.7, 95% CI 1.4; 5.7), and can serve as a potential trigger for chronic stress development in clinical nurses. In terms of emotion-focused stress control (β 0.1, 95% CI −0.1; −0.2,R2= 0.12), Lithuanian nurses had low control of the perceived chronic stress. The use of problem-focused coping (β −0.2, 95% CI −0.3; −0.1,R2= 0.09) was also not addressed to an appropriate extent. The use of the avoidance coping style was associated with moderate–high levels of chronic stress perceived by nurses (β 0.5, 95% CI 0.4; 0.7,R2= 0.24). Furthermore, the avoidant coping strategy related to behavioral disengagement was significantly related to resilience to chronic stress in an adverse way. The cognitive process of self-blame was considered as a meaningful maladaptive behavior component for magnifying chronic stress in nurses. (4)Conclusions: The study highlights the need to implement the recommendations for boosting the nurses’ mental health. Hospitals should contribute to psychological assistance along with providing necessary training on stress-coping strategies for clinical nurses. In order to promote the sustainability of mental health through additional social support interventions, it would be useful to upgrade the clinical nurses’ daily routines with mindfulness-based trainings.',\n",
       " 'A complete science of human behavior requires a comprehensive account of the verbal behavior those humans exhibit. Existing behavioral theories of such verbal behavior have produced compelling insight into language’s underlying function, but the expansive program of research those theories deserve has unfortunately been slow to develop. We argue that the status quo’s manually implemented and study-specific coding systems are too resource intensive to be worthwhile for most behavior analysts. These high input costs in turn discourage research on verbal behavior overall. We propose lexicon-based sentiment analysis as a more modern and efficient approach to the study of human verbal products, especially naturally occurring ones (e.g., psychotherapy transcripts, social media posts). In the present discussion, we introduce the reader to principles of sentiment analysis, highlighting its usefulness as a behavior analytic tool for the study of verbal behavior. We conclude with an outline of approaches for handling some of the more complex forms of speech, like negation, sarcasm, and speculation. The appendix also provides a worked example of how sentiment analysis could be applied to existing questions in behavior analysis, complete with code that readers can incorporate into their own work.',\n",
       " 'The possibility of facing an epidemic or pandemic resulting in mandatory isolation or quarantine has become a relevant construct for comparing and evaluating coping strategies under such conditions. The objective of this research was to develop and analyze the psychometric properties of a scale to assess quarantine coping strategies (Q-COPE). This was an instrumental study and 1110 Peruvian adults (M = 26.9 years; SD = 9.77) participated in the context of social isolation. For the construction of the scale, qualitative and quantitative procedures were followed. The internal structure was evaluated by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The content analysis by expert judges supports the representativeness of the items related to the construct. EFA and CFA allowed the establishment of five factors: Emotional regulation, Information, Accommodation, Social support, and Altruism. The first-order model presents adequate goodness-of-fit indices: χ2= 489.048, df = 220, χ2/df = 2.223, SRMR = 0.025, CFI = 0.969, TLI = 0.965, RMSEA = 0.047. Likewise, the second order model presented similar values: χ2= 499.674, df = 225, χ2/df = 2.221, SRMR = 0.026, CFI = 0.969, TLI = 0.965, RMSEA = 0.047. The 23-item version was consistent with the proposed theory, obtained adequate fit indices and acceptable factor loadings (>0.70), and presented good internal consistency indexes evaluated by Cronbach’s α, ordinal α, omega (ω), and H coefficient. It is concluded that the Q-COPE scale presents good psychometric properties that justify its use in an adult population and allows the assessment of the coping strategies that people use in the face of a quarantine situation.',\n",

With a sample of 927 participants, our results show that the severity of COVID-19 was predictive of all the responses, and its predictive value was more pronounced relative to personality traits. Concerning the association between personality traits and responses, Honesty-Humility and Conscientiousness were predictive of one’s behaviors, Emotionality was predictive of one’s worries, and almost all the HEXACO traits were associated with one’s attitudes toward people infected with COVID-19.

The results indicate that fatalism has a negative impact on quality of life and a positive effect on negative affect, and loneliness moderates both relationships, supporting the conclusion that fatalism exacerbates the effect of well-being indicators and negative affect.',\n",
       " 'PurposeDuring the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare professionals were more frequently affected by post-traumatic stress disorder than the general population. The purpose of this historical, prospective study was to determine the influence of occupational stressors and personality traits on the magnitude of post-traumatic stress symptoms in nurses. The secondary objective was to examine the mediating role of protective equipment use on the relationship between exposure to pandemic-related stressors and levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms in nurses.MethodsThe study was conducted after the first wave of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic among nurses working at the University Hospital of Split, Croatia. A total of 380 nurses completed the web-based survey. Among them, 217 (57.1%) worked with COVID-19 patients and 163 (42.9%) worked in non-COVID departments. A quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, and comparative design was used.ResultsPersonality traits (introversion, neuroticism, and openness), along with exposure to work stressors (public criticism, workplace hazards and harms, and work conflicts) and direct exposure to work with patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, may serve as significant risk factors for the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms (p< 0.05). The use of protective equipment did not alter the effect of exposure to pandemic-related stressors on the amount of trauma experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.ConclusionPersonality characteristics and levels of work stress are the most important predictors of the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms in nurses who worked during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare facilities and their leaders need to make more efforts to provide better psychosocial support services for nurses.',\n",
       " 'The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) resulted in lockdowns and social distancing measures enforced by governments around the world. This study aimed to identify changes in adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and physical activity (PA) and associations with personality during lockdown. Using a cross-sectional design, a convenient sample of 543 adults in Qatar completed an online questionnaire consisting of validated tools to measure adherence to MD (MEDAS questionnaire, score ranges 0–13), PA (IPAQ, assessing light, moderate high intensity PA) and personality (BFI-10, categorizing individuals’ personalities). The majority of the participants were female (89%), aged between 21 and 29 years (45%). The overall MD adherence decreased during lockdown (5.9 vs. 6.1, p < 0.001). There was an increase in olive oil (9% vs. 12%; p < 0.001), vegetables (54.3% vs. 58.7%; p = 0.005), legumes (11.8% vs. 15.3%; p = 0.007), sofrito (70.9% vs. 77.3%; p < 0.001) and fat (45.9% vs. 53.8%; p < 0.001) consumption and a decrease in fresh fruit (39.4% vs. 15.8%; p < 0.001) and fish/seafood (5.9% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.0035) consumption during lockdown. Met-min/week values of total PA (1330.5 vs. 1836.7), vigorous activity (711.5 vs. 867.4), moderate activity (208.3 vs. 301.3), and walking (410.7 vs. 668.0) all decreased during lockdown (p < 0.001, p = 0.010, p = 0.010 p < 0.001, respectively), while sitting increased (3837.3 vs. 2896.4 p < 0.001). The extraversion personality dimension had a higher MD adherence (p = 0.039) compared to agreeableness before lockdown. No changes in MEDAS scores were observed during lockdown in those with high levels of openness. Openness was positively associated with all PA (p= 0.027), including walking (p= 0.026), and negatively associated with sitting (p= 0.038) before lockdown, while participants with high scores for neuroticism were less likely to be sitting during lockdown (p= 0.042).

       " 'Thriving at work is a psychological construct associated with being well and doing well in the workplace and is operationalized as a composite score of vitality and learning. The problem addressed by this study was the growing concern that a composite score for thriving at work does not account for how the sub-components of vitality and learning may be differentially associated with important outcomes. The purpose of this quantitative correlational research study was to determine how various combinations of the two components of thriving at work related to job satisfaction and burnout in teachers during the COVID–19 pandemic. Survey data from a sample of 148 K–12 teachers in the US, recruited by Qualtrics, were analyzed using polynomial regression with response surface analysis. Results showed high levels of both vitality and learning (ie, high thriving) were associated with more favorable outcomes than low levels of the sub-components (ie, low thriving), as the socially embedded model of thriving at work would predict. The results also provided new insight into how other combinations of vitality and learning relate to satisfaction and burnout. Combinations of vitality and learning that produced mid-level thriving scores revealed a wide range of less desirable outcomes, particularly at the extremes of low vitality/high learning. This finding suggests possible tipping points where increased learning without accompanying vitality leads to increased emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Based on these results, it is recommended that researchers, administrators and policymakers, and individual teachers recognize the potential of thriving at work to influence important outcomes and begin to take actions to assess, monitor, and influence teachers’ levels of vitality and learning. Further research is recommended after the pandemic to determine if and how the results differ. Researchers might also extend the current results to determine if combinations of vitality and learning in teachers are related to student outcomes.',\n",

A total of 811 participants (52% females) from 13 districts in Wuhan were invited to complete surveys regarding demographics, psychosocial factors and compliance with epidemic prevention guidelines. Individual-level characteristics were combined with district-level measures to create multilevel predictive models of compliance with prevention guidelines, and used the Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) to analyze the data. Findings revealed that there were significant differences in the compliance of citizens from 13 districts of Wuhan (F= 5.65,P< 0.001). Hierarchical linear model analysis revealed that the risk factors case growth rate, COVID-19-related perceived stress, anxiety, significantly negatively predicted compliance. Hope and conscientiousness significantly positively predicted compliance with prevention guidelines, and the negative predictive effect of anxiety disappeared. Overall, we found significant differences in compliance with prevention guidelines among different districts. Risk factors at the individual level have had a negative impact on individuals’ compliance with prevention guidelines, but this impact can be mitigated by the positive role of personal protective factors such as conscientiousness and hope.',\n",

However, there is a research gap in determining the optimal preprocessing strategy in BTC tweets to develop an accurate machine learning prediction model for bitcoin prices. This paper develops different text preprocessing strategies for correlating the sentiment scores of Twitter text with Bitcoin prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the effect of different preprocessing functions, features, and time lengths of data on the correlation results. Out of 13 strategies, we discover that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices. The prices only correlate well with sentiment scores over shorter timespans. Selecting the optimum preprocessing strategy would prompt machine learning prediction models to achieve better accuracy as compared to the actual prices.',\n",

We find that the first local diagnosis leads to an immediate increase in racist Google searches and Twitter posts, with the latter mainly coming from existing Twitter users posting the slur for the first time. This increase could indicate a rise in future hate crimes, as we document a strong correlation between the use of the slur and anti-Asian hate crimes using historic data. Moreover, we find that the rise in the animosity is directed at Asians rather than other minority groups and is stronger on days when the connection between the disease and Asians is more salient, as proxied by President Trump's tweets mentioning China and Covid-19 at the same time.

Our findings reveal that users in Washington were more active on Twitter than users in Louisiana in terms of the total number and density of COVID-19-related tweets during the early stage of the pandemic. Our correlation analysis results for counties or parishes show that the Twitter activities (tweet density, COVID-19 tweet density, and user density) were positively correlated with population density in both states at the 0.01 level of significance. Our sentiment analysis results demonstrate that the average daily sentiment scores of all and COVID-19-related tweets in Washington were consistently higher than those in Louisiana during this period.

In this paper, a social media user geolocation algorithm based on cyclic coupling (called UGCC) is proposed. We collapse the social graph based on the neighbor location proximity, which reduces noisy information while enriching social relationships. Unlike existing methods that ignore the social graph's structure, UGCC measures the probability of users being in the candidate locations according to users’ structural location in the social sub-graph.

In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap with fine-grained analysis. We find that tweets with a controversial term can be easily distinguished from those with neutral terms using state-of-the-art classifiers, that they cover different substantive topics, and that they possess different linguistic features reflecting sentiment and psychological states. All evidence suggests that the real life use of the controversial terms is distinctively different from that of the neutral terms.',\n",
       " 'This paper explores eight Kazakhstani postgraduate students’ reflections of their international educational experiences in the UK after their immediate re-entry into Kazakhstan. Special focus was on their language identity development after their one-year stay in the UK. It was informed by Benson et al.’s ([2013].Second Language Identity in Narratives of Study Abroad. London: Palgrave Macmillan) three-dimensional model of L2 identity: (a) identity-related aspects of L2 proficiency, (b) linguistic self-concept, and (c) L2-mediated aspects of personal development. The qualitative data collected from a written narrative and three subsequent rounds of individual semi-structured interviews suggest that most participants had lofty goals in the first period of their study abroad. They gradually became aware that full immersion in the host country could take a long time, and accordingly, they set concrete goals. The analysis of the data also revealed that the participants exercised their agency in displaying their development of sociopragmatic competence and a global citizenship identity, by respecting different opinions and accepting cultural differences. Nevertheless, some of them experienced racism based on their usage of English and presumed ethnicity. This study underlines the significance of introducing pedagogical interventions in all phases of study abroad to avoid student sojourners’ unrealistic or impractical goals and empower their language identities.',\n",
       " 'This paper proposes an innovative COVID-19 stochastic model to secure communication systems for transferring and storing epidemic data. Considering the observable and non-observable COVID-19 states such as infection, confirmed/unconfirmed cases, recovery, and reported/unreported deaths, the dynamic COVID-19 framework is developed and verified. For transmitting local observation information to the central control center like CDC, an innovative internet of things (IoT) based secure communication system is proposed. For predicting COVID-19 model, an optimal signal processing algorithm is developed and implemented. Based on the designed gain, the dynamic system forecasting error is reduced to develop an accurate COVID-19 prediction method. Extensive results show that the proposed technique can properly forecast COVID-19 states within a short period of time. Consequently, the developed simulator and analysis is observed as a valuable resource for COVID-19 state prediction, proactive action and also for information security and privacy.',\n",
       " 'Spatio-temporal data possess intrinsic values, reflecting the spatial and temporal features of people’s behaviors. Due to the sensitive nature of this data (e.g., workplace, residence, school locations), privacy protection is essential when collecting spatio-temporal data. Local Differential Privacy (LDP) protocol has gained attention as a method for protecting privacy on data-collecting devices. LDP protocol can make each data indistinguishable but inevitably destroys spatial/temporal characteristics as well. In this paper, we propose a novel method enabling LDP protocol to preserve spatial/temporal trends on privacy protection. If we collect data from users with similar behavior, it is difficult to uniquely identify users from the beginning. In short, processing privacy protection for each user with similar behavior allow us to minimize the removal of intrinsic values by LDP protocol. Our method, termed Dynamic Differentially-Private Spatial Decomposition (D2-PSD), dynamically adjusts and controls the strength of privacy protection (privacy budget) for each group of users exhibiting similar spatial and temporal trends. This allows users to be indistinguishable from each other within a group while preserving spatial and temporal trends across groups. All groups will have a different privacy budget, but the sum of the entire group keeps a constant privacy budget. Even if group with different protection strengths are mixed, privacy is protected for the sum of the group, and our proposed method can always guarantee a constant protection strength. Experimental results demonstrate that our method retains the intrinsic spatial and temporal trends in spatio-temporal data while maintaining robust privacy protection across the entire dataset, thanks to the D2-PSD approach. Specifically, in the most similar groups, D²-PSD reduced the MAE by up to 75% compared to standard LDP, while maintaining an equivalent strength of privacy protection.',\n",

Although previous studies showed the potential of user profiling in hate speech detection in social media, there has not been a thorough analysis of users’ characteristics and dispositions to understand the development of hate attitudes among users. To bridge this gap, we investigate the role of a wide range of psycholinguistic and behavioral traits in characterizing and distinguishing users prone to post hate speech on social media.

In addition to the enormous health cost, the necessary lockdowns and government‐mandated suspension to prevent the spread of the virus had a huge economic impact. The new challenges in 2021 were combating new virus mutations and providing effective vaccines globally. Artificial intelligent (AI) and machine learning have made significant improvements in many different applications during the last decades. One of the advanced and robust technologies in machine learning is deep learning (DL), which can be employed to help prevent initial infections and detect and monitor their progress and side effects. Fast and accurate Covid‐19 infection detection and treatment of suspected patients is essential to make better decisions, ensure treatment, and even save patients' lives. Modern technologies are required to achieve these objectives and create a sustainable society. This article presents a taxonomy in DL algorithms to cover both the technical novelties and empirical results techniques for Covid‐19 in smart cities. In this regard, (i) we demonstrate possible DL algorithms capable of combating Covid‐19; (ii) we propose an up‐to‐date perspective of DL algorithms in social prevention and medical treatment; and (iii) we identify the challenges in combating Covid‐19 outbreaks.\",\n",
       " 'The COVID-19 pandemic, a global contagion of coronavirus infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has triggered severe social and economic disruption around the world and provoked changes in people’s behavior. Given the extreme societal impact of COVID-19, it becomes crucial to understand the emotional response of the people and the impact of COVID-19 on personality traits and psychological dimensions. In this study, we contribute to this goal by thoroughly analyzing the evolution of personality and psychological aspects in a large-scale collection of tweets extracted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this research are: i) to provide evidence that helps to understand the estimated impact of the pandemic on people’s temperament, ii) to find associations and trends between specific events (e.g., stages of harsh confinement) and people’s reactions, and iii) to study the evolution of multiple personality aspects, such as the degree of introversion or the level of neuroticism. We also examine the development of emotions, as a natural complement to the automatic analysis of the personality dimensions. To achieve our goals, we have created two large collections of tweets (geotagged in the United States and Spain, respectively), collected during the pandemic. Our work reveals interesting trends in personality dimensions, emotions, and events. For example, during the pandemic period, we found increasing traces of introversion and neuroticism. Another interesting insight from our study is that the most frequent signs of personality disorders are those related to depression, schizophrenia, and narcissism. We also found some peaks of negative/positive emotions related to specific events.',\n",

The study, part of a larger archival research effort investigating automatic methods for appraisal and description of very large digital archival collections, used a Three-step Social Media Similarity (TSMS) mapping method that aggregates hashtag mapping, TF-IDF Similarity Selection, and Emotion Similarity Calculation on the test collection. Compared to using a purely lexicon-based method to identify and analyze controversial speech, this method successfully expanded the amount of controversial contents detected from 21,050 tweets to 212,605, and the detection rate from 0.6% to 6.1%. We argue that the TSMS method could be similarly applied by archives in automatically identifying, analyzing, describing other controversial content on social media and in other rapidly evolving and complex contexts in order to increase public awareness and facilitate public policy responses.',\n",

We first analyze patient and route data of infected patients from January 20, 2020, to May 31, 2020, collected by the Korean Center for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) and discover how infection clusters develop as a function of time. This analysis offers a statistical characterization of mobility habits and patterns of individuals at the beginning of the pandemic. While the KCDC data offer a wealth of information, they are also by their nature limited. To compensate for their limitations, we use detailed mobility data from Berlin, Germany after observing that mobility of individuals is surprisingly similar in both Berlin and Seoul. Using information from the Berlin mobility data, we cross-fertilize the KCDC Seoul data set and use it to parameterize an agent-based simulation that models the spread of the disease in an urban environment.

The goal of this study is to examine, among college students, the relationship between deteriorating mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. This study recruited a cohort of 49 students from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental health profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included late-night online activities, continuous usages, and time away from the internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions, social activities, and personal affairs.

       " 'It is well-established that, in the past few years, internet users have rapidly increased. Meanwhile, various types of fake information (such as fake news or rumors) have been flooding social media platforms or online communities. The effective containing or controlling of fake news or rumor has drawn wide attention from areas such as academia to social media platforms. For that reason, numerous studies have focused on this subject from different perspectives, such as employing complex networks and spreading models. However, in the real online community, misinformation usually spreads quickly to thousands of users within minutes. Conventional studies are too theoretical or complicated to be applied to practical applications, and show a lack of fast responsiveness and poor containing effects. Therefore, in this work, a hybrid strategy exploiting the multi-dimensional data of users and content was proposed for the fast containing of fake information in the online community. The strategy is mainly composed of three steps: the fast detection of fake information by continuously updating the content comparison dataset according to the specific hot topic and the fake contents; creating spreading force models and user divisions via historical data, and limiting the propagation of fake information based on the content and user division. Finally, an experiment was set up online with BBS (Bulletin Board System), and the acquired results were analyzed by comparison with other methods in different metrics. From the extracted results, it has been demonstrated that the proposed solution clearly outperforms traditional methods.',\n",

       " 'In recent years, social media have dramatically improved the dissemination speed of information, which also includes health misinformation. To date, most of the computational approaches to addressing this problem have focused on detecting and flagging misinformation content. However, the majority of these approaches have overlooked many important aspects of health misinformation, such as the behavior of evidence sources and the sharing decisions of social media users. To address the limitations, this dissertation research develops an evidence-based approach to detecting health misinformation and to intervening user sharing intention on social media sites. This work takes on a new perspective regarding health misinformation by understanding user stance (ie, for, against, neutral) due to their motivation of influencing others. Moreover, this research investigates arguments that combine both stance and evidence for assessing the credibility of health information for the very first time. Our analysis of evidence distribution in health information tweets shows that 70% of tweets contain source-based evidence, which provides the foundation for proposing an evidence-based approach to misinformation detection. Based on these results, we built argument detection models to identify stance positions within arguments. Our results demonstrate the importance of evidence-based features in identifying the stance within arguments on social media sites. Drawing on the evidentiality theory, information credibility heuristics, and consistency heuristics, we propose a research model that seeks to explain health misinformation detection and sharing behavior with evidence-based interventions. To test the research model, we designed and developed eleven types of evidence-based digital nudges and used them to conduct user experiments. The empirical results demonstrate that our nudge design improves credibility assessment of health misinformation. This dissertation makes several research contributions. First, it extends an evidentiality theory and credibility cognitive heuristics provided by health experts to analyze the types of evidence included in health-related user generated content Second, it presents an evidence-based schema for categorizing evidence in user generated content. Third, it uses evidentiality theory as the kernel theory to guide the design of digital nudges. In particular, it illustrates how evidence-based design artifacts can be used to support augmented intelligence for mitigating the spread of health-related misinformation on social media sites. Finally, it combines cognitive heuristics to the design of digital nudges. Specifically, it uses information credibility and consistency heuristics to analyze user generated content on social media sites.

In this study, we analyzed and compared the data on Twitter and Weibo at different times based on the public’s understanding of COVID-19 to ultimately understand the characteristics of social media reaction in U.S. and in China during the pandemic. Results show that both similarities and differences existed when comparing the public reaction on social media in the U.S. and in China. The study suggests that data from social media could be used as a good reflection of the public’s reaction, especially in a pandemic like COVID-19. It is important for the government to understand people’s timely reaction during the pandemic in order to ensure the authorities are on the right direction to provide services and accurate information to the public.',\n",
       " \"In this thesis, we develop methodologies to enhance the robustness of current neural models for online toxicity detection. Specifically, we aim at adding predictive power and interpretability to transformer-based models. To improve the predictive power of a transformer-based model, we propose to further pre-train the model on the domain-related corpus, ie, social media text. To add interpretability to a transformer-based model, we introduce a simple and effective assumption, that a post is at least as toxic as its most toxic span, to empower the model with the ability to explain its output during prediction. We incorporate this assumption into transformer-based models by scoring a post based on the maximum toxicity of its spans and augmenting the training process to identify correct spans. The experiments have shown that our proposed idea of further pre-training can improve the model's performance for toxicity detection. We also find our proposed approach that incorporates interpretability does not injure the predictive power of the model and can produce explanations that exceed the quality of those provided by Logistic Regression analysis (often regarded as a highly interpretable model), according to a human study. We also find that our proposed approach can be generalized to different transformer-based models and even different domain tasks.\",\n",

       " 'This chapter documents seven Kazakhstani postgraduate students’ study abroad experiences to discover whether and to what extent they were able to develop intercultural citizenship after their one-year stay in the UK. Intercultural citizenship refers to ‘the extension of citizenship beyond national borders, through recognition of the global scale of social relations, the need to respect and value diversity, and participation in and responsibility to communities at multiple levels from the local to the global’ (Baker & Fang, , p.\\xa03). The qualitative data revealed that the time away from Kazakhstan, combined with the experience of contact with other nationalities, enabled many participants to look at Kazakhstan and its culture more objectively. This increased objectivity resulted in them developing greater tolerance of cultural differences, respecting different opinions (e.g., attitudes toward LGBT individuals) and learning to be comfortable in multicultural environments. Nevertheless, some participants articulated limitations to their ability to develop their intercultural citizenship, including their attempts to match idealised ‘native speaker’ norms and experiencing racism based on their usage of English and presumed ethnicity. This chapter concludes by stressing the need for intercultural interventions in all phases of study abroad to foster and cultivate students’ sense of intercultural citizenship.',\n",

The increase of such discrimination and hate may be attributed to negative perceptions of the origins of the COVID-19 virus. During the pandemic, the use of stigmatizing language, such as “China virus”, on social media platforms propagated a negative association of the virus with Asians. This paper addresses how the theory of Social Construction of Target Populations applied to policies aimed at Asian Americans due to the pandemic. As Twitter is the prominent micro bloggingsocial media site that allows users to share their thoughts and opinions, the use of anti-Asian key terms and hashtagsare scrutinized in this project. This research project aims to determinetrends in use of anti-Asian key terms andany correlation with incidences ofhate crime toward Asians due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study show that both the use of anti-Asian terminology and hate crimes increased during 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This project also reveals a strong correlation between the use of anti-Asian key terms and or hashtags and anti-Asian hate crimes during this period.

In pursuing these goals, the work is divided into two parts. The first part of the paper analyzes the existential dissemination of information about the first and second wave of COVID-19 pandemics in the world with a focus on social networks and citizen writing–an audience about pandemics that has undoubtedly taken all the notes of infodemium where it is difficult to determine the information value of comments or writing prosumer.

In this study, we introduce a novel approach, coined LLM-Rec, which incorporates four distinct prompting strategies of text enrichment for improving personalized text-based recommendations. Our empirical experiments reveal that using LLM-augmented text significantly enhances recommendation quality. Even basic MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) models achieve comparable or even better results than complex content-based methods. Notably, the success of LLM-Rec lies in its prompting strategies, which effectively tap into the language model's comprehension of both general and specific item characteristics.

Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders cannot meet the inference latency demand of industrial recommender systems. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs — the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms.

       " 'This paper introduces PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM) inference engine on a personal computer (PC) equipped with a single consumer-grade GPU. The key principle underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting the high locality inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law distribution in neuron activation. This distribution indicates that a small subset of neurons, termedhot neurons, are consistently activated across inputs, while the majority,cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs. PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine: hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while cold-activated neurons are computed on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers. PowerInfer further integrates adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators, optimizing the efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity. The evaluation shows that PowerInfer significantly outperformsllama.cppby up to 11.69× while retaining model accuracy across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. For the OPT-30B model, PowerInfer achieves performance comparable to that of a high-end server-grade A100 GPU, reaching 82% of its token generation rate on a single consumer-grade RTX 4090 GPU.',\n",

However, due to the significant costs involved in re-training or fine-tuning them, they remain largely static and difficult to personalize. Nevertheless, a variety of applications could benefit from generations that are tailored to users' preferences, goals, and knowledge. Among them is web search, where knowing what a user is trying to accomplish, what they care about, and what they know can lead to improved search experiences. In this work, we propose a novel and general approach that augments an LLM with relevant context from users' interaction histories with a search engine in order to personalize its outputs. Specifically, we construct an entity-centric knowledge store for each user based on their search and browsing activities on the web, which is then leveraged to provide contextually relevant LLM prompt augmentations. This knowledge store is light-weight, since it only produces user-specific aggregate projections of interests and knowledge onto public knowledge graphs, and leverages existing search log infrastructure, thereby mitigating the privacy, compliance, and scalability concerns associated with building deep user profiles for personalization. We validate our approach on the task of contextual query suggestion, which requires understanding not only the user's current search context but also what they historically know and care about. Through a number of experiments based on human evaluation, we show that our approach is significantly better than several other LLM-powered baselines, generating query suggestions that are contextually more relevant, personalized, and useful.\",\n",

One is a comprehensive set of domain data that is typically large-scale and continuously evolving. The other is specific working patterns of this domain reflected in the data. The absence or inadequacy of such knowledge impacts the performance of the LLM. In this paper, we propose a general paradigm that augments LLMs with DOmain-specific KnowledgE to enhance their performance on practical applications, namely DOKE. This paradigm relies on a domain knowledge extractor, working in three steps: 1) preparing effective knowledge for the task; 2) selecting the knowledge for each specific sample; and 3) expressing the knowledge in an LLM-understandable way. Then, the extracted knowledge is incorporated through prompts, without any computational cost of model fine-tuning. We instantiate the general paradigm on a widespread application, i.e. recommender systems, where critical item attributes and collaborative filtering signals are incorporated.

This generation inefficiency stems from the autoregressive nature of LLMs, and a promising direction for acceleration is speculative decoding, a Draft-then-Verify paradigm that increases the number of generated tokens per decoding step. In this paper, we first identify that recommendation knowledge generation is suitable for retrieval-based speculative decoding. Then, we discern two characteristics: (1) extensive items and users in RSs bring retrieval inefficiency, and (2) RSs exhibit high diversity tolerance for text generated by LLMs. Based on the above insights, we propose a Decoding Acceleration Framework for LLM-based Recommendation (dubbed DARE), with Customized Retrieval Pool to improve retrieval efficiency and Relaxed Verification to increase the acceptance rate of draft tokens, respectively.

       " \"Learning from demonstrations is a common way for users to teach robots, but it is prone to spurious feature correlations. Recent work constructs state abstractions, i.e. visual representations containing task-relevant features, from language as a way to perform more generalizable learning. However, these abstractions also depend on a user's preference for what matters in a task, which may be hard to describe or infeasible to exhaustively specify using language alone. How do we construct abstractions to capture these latent preferences? We observe that how humans behave reveals how they see the world. Our key insight is that changes in human behavior inform us that there are differences in preferences for how humans see the world, i.e. their state abstractions. In this work, we propose using language models (LMs) to query for those preferences directly given knowledge that a change in behavior has occurred. In our framework, we use the LM in two ways: first, given a text description of the task and knowledge of behavioral change between states, we query the LM for possible hidden preferences; second, given the most likely preference, we query the LM to construct the state abstraction. In this framework, the LM is also able to ask the human directly when uncertain about its own estimate. We demonstrate our framework's ability to construct effective preference-conditioned abstractions in simulated experiments, a user study, as well as on a real Spot robot performing mobile manipulation tasks.\",\n",

Unlike existing work, this survey does not merely analyze the classifications of LLM-based recommendation systems according to the technical framework of LLMs. Instead, it investigates how LLMs can better serve recommendation tasks from the perspective of the recommender system community, thus enhancing the integration of large language models into the research of recommender system and its practical application.

On the other hand, the nature of political questions often renders the direct facts elusive, necessitating deeper aggregation and comprehension of retrieved evidence.

With MVPKG as its foundation, PEG enhances existing methods through knowledge acquisition, aggregation, and injection. This process begins with refining evidence through semantic filtering, followed by its aggregation into global knowledge via implicit or explicit methods. The integrated knowledge is then utilized by LLMs through prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets across diverse LLMs confirm PEG's superiority in tackling political modeling tasks.\",\n",

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in bridging this gap. However, previous attempts to directly implement LLMs as recommenders fall short in meeting the requirements of industrial RSs, particularly in terms of online inference latency and offline resource efficiency.

We develop individual knowledge extraction and collective knowledge extraction tailored for different scales of scenarios, effectively reducing offline resource consumption. Subsequently, generated knowledge undergoes efficient transformation and condensation into augmented vectors through a hybridized expert-integrated network, ensuring compatibility. The obtained vectors can then be used to enhance any conventional recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that REKI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with lots of recommendation algorithms and tasks.

To address this issue, this paper proposes GANPrompt, a multi-dimensional large language model prompt diversity framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The framework enhances the model's adaptability and stability to diverse prompts by integrating GAN generation techniques with the deep semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. GANPrompt first trains a generator capable of producing diverse prompts by analysing multidimensional user behavioural data. These diverse prompts are then used to train the LLM to improve its performance in the face of unseen prompts. Furthermore, to ensure a high degree of diversity and relevance of the prompts, this study introduces a mathematical theory-based diversity constraint mechanism that optimises the generated prompts to ensure that they are not only superficially distinct, but also semantically cover a wide range of user intentions.

       " 'Large Language Models are revolutionizing Web, mobile, and Web of Things systems, driving intelligent and scalable solutions. However, as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems expand, they encounter significant challenges related to scalability, including increased delay and communication overhead. To address these issues, we propose EACO-RAG, an edge-assisted distributed RAG system that leverages adaptive knowledge updates and inter-node collaboration. By distributing vector datasets across edge nodes and optimizing retrieval processes, EACO-RAG significantly reduces delay and resource consumption while enhancing response accuracy. The system employs a multi-armed bandit framework with safe online Bayesian methods to balance performance and cost. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that EACO-RAG outperforms traditional centralized RAG systems in both response time and resource efficiency. EACO-RAG effectively reduces delay and resource expenditure to levels comparable to, or even lower than, those of local RAG systems, while significantly improving accuracy. This study presents the first systematic exploration of edge-assisted distributed RAG architectures, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale distributed environments.',\n",

Ensuring data accuracy within graph database engines is paramount, as inaccuracies can yield unreliable analytical outcomes. Current bug-detection approaches are confined to specific graph query languages, limiting their applicabilities when handling graph database engines that use various graph query languages across various domains. Moreover, they require extensive prior knowledge to generate queries for detecting bugs. To address these challenges, we introduces DGDB, a novel paradigm harnessing large language models(LLM), such as ChatGPT, for comprehensive bug detection in graph database engines. DGDB leverages ChatGPT to generate high-quality queries for different graph query languages. It subsequently employs differential testing to identify bugs in graph database engines. We applied this paradigm to graph database engines using the Gremlin query language and those using the Cypher query language, generating approximately 4,000 queries each.

       " 'In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions. In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FM). While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval. In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization. Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types. To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity. To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type. This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data. Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform.',\n",

       " \"Sequential recommendation in e-commerce leverages users' anonymous browsing histories to offer personalized product suggestions without relying on personal information. While item ID-based sequential recommendations are commonly used, they often fail to fully capture the diverse factors influencing user preferences, such as textual descriptions, visual content, and pricing. These factors represent distinct modalities in recommender systems. Existing multimodal sequential recommendation models typically employ either early or late fusion of different modalities, overlooking the alignment of corresponding positions in time of product sequences that represent users' browsing preferences. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified framework for multimodal fusion in recommender systems, introducing the Multimodal Time-aligned Shared Token Recommender (MTSTRec). MTSTRec leverages a transformer-based architecture that incorporates a single time-aligned shared token for each product, allowing for efficient cross-modality fusion that also aligns in time. This approach not only preserves the distinct contributions of each modality but also aligns them to better capture user preferences. Additionally, the model extracts rich features from text, images, and other product data, offering a more comprehensive representation of user decision-making in e-commerce. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTSTRec achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sequential recommendation benchmarks, significantly improving upon existing multimodal fusion strategies.\",\n",

Here we study the evolution and spread of anti-Asian hate speech through the lens of Twitter. We create COVID-HATE, the largest dataset of anti-Asian hate and counterhate spanning three months, containing over 30 million tweets, and a social network with over 87 million nodes. By creating a novel hand-labeled dataset of 2,400 tweets, we train a text classifier to identify hate and counterhate tweets that achieves an average AUROC of 0.852. We identify 891,204 hate and 200,198 counterhate tweets in COVID-HATE. Using this data to conduct longitudinal analysis, we find that while hateful users are less engaged in the COVID-19 discussions prior to their first anti-Asian tweet, they become more vocal and engaged afterwards compared to counterhate users. We find that bots comprise 10.4% of hateful users and are more vocal and hateful compared to non-bot users. Comparing bot accounts, we show that hateful bots are more successful in attracting followers compared to counterhate bots. Analysis of the social network reveals that hateful and counterhate users interact and engage extensively with one another, instead of living in isolated polarized communities. Furthermore, we find that hate is contagious and nodes are highly likely to become hateful after being exposed to hateful content. Importantly, our analysis reveals that counterhate messages can discourage users from turning hateful in the first place.

By suppressing the impulse to distinguish between truth and falsehood, which has characterized most scholarship on the COVID-19 “infodemic,” and engaging with claims surrounding two popular COVID-19 conspiracies—on 5G and on Bill Gates—in South Africa and Nigeria, we illustrate how conspiracies morph as they interact with different socio-political contexts. Drawing on a mixed-method analysis of more than 6 million tweets, we examine how, in each country, conspiracies have uniquely intersected with longer-term discourses and political projects. In Nigeria, the two conspiracies were both seized as opportunities to extend criticism to the ruling party. In South Africa, they produced distinctive responses: while the 5G conspiracy had limited buy-in, the Gates conspiracy resonated with deep-rooted resentment toward the West, corporate interests, and what is seen as a paternalistic attitude of some external actors toward Africa. These findings stress the importance of taking conspiracy theories seriously, rather than dismissing them simply as negative externalities of digital ecosystems. Situating conspiracies in specific dynamics of trust and mistrust can make an important difference when designing responses that are not limited to broadcasting truthful information, but can also enable interventions that account for deeply rooted sentiments of suspicion toward specific issues and actors, which can vary significantly across communities.',\n",

A series of policy shifts by various governmental bodies have been speculated to have contributed to the polarization of face masks. A typical method to investigate the effects of these policy shifts is to use surveys. However, survey-based approaches have multiple limitations: biased responses, limited sample size, badly crafted questions may skew responses and inhibit insight, and responses may prove quickly irrelevant as opinions change in response to a dynamic topic. We propose a novel approach to 1) accurately gauge public sentiment towards face masks in the United States during COVID-19 using a multi-modal demographic inference framework with topic modeling and 2) determine whether face mask policy shifts contributed to polarization towards face masks using offline change point analysis on Twitter data. First, we infer several key demographics of individual Twitter users such as their age, gender, and whether they are a college student using a multi-modal demographic prediction framework and analyze the average sentiment for each respective demographic. Next, we conduct topic analysis using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Finally, we conduct offline change point discovery on our sentiment time series data using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) search algorithm.

The aim of this study is to understand which economic topics news media focused on alongside the dominant health coverage, which topics did not surface, and how these topics influenced each other and evolved over time and space. To this end, we used an extensive open-source dataset of over 350,000 media articles on non-medical aspects of COVID-19 retrieved from over 60 top-tier business blogs and news sites. We referred to the World Economic Forum’s Strategic Intelligence taxonomy to categorize the articles into a variety of topics. In doing so, we found that in the early days of COVID-19, the news media focused predominantly on reporting new cases, which tended to overshadow other topics, such as the economic impact of the virus. Different independent news sources reported on the same topics, showing a herd behavior of the news media during this global health crisis. However, a temporal analysis of news distribution in relation to its geographic focus showed that the rise in COVID-19 cases was associated with an increase in media coverage of relevant socio-economic topics.

       " 'Social media provide users with a powerful platform to share their ideas. Using one’s right to expression to incite hate toward a particular group of people is inappropriate. However, hate speech is pervasive in our society. Spreading hate through online social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, and Instagram is commonplace in today’s milieu. One such case is the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, which engendered anti-Asian hate. In the current literature, there is limited study on using user features in conjunction with textual features to detect hate speech. In this paper, we propose to combine tweet textual features with a variety of user features to improve the state-of-the-art hate speech detection techniques. The user feature we propose consists of demographic, behavioral-based, network-based, emotions, personality, readability, and writing style. To test our approach, we used four different English datasets gathered from Twitter and available in the public domain. Our results show that combining tweet textual features with the proposed user features improves hate speech detection up to +0.32 in F1 score and beats previously proposed approaches that use a limited number of user features. The analysis of the most important features confirms that hateful tweets or their authors express more negative emotions and use more swear words.',\n",

Employing methods from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), the analysis reveals a predominance of positive sentiment from December 7, 2022 to May 17, 2023, indicative of an optimistic perspective and a potentially flourishing environment. A predictive model based on logistic regression emerges as a notably effective tool for sentiment prediction, suggesting potential utility in predicting future public health crises. A comparison of sentiments in translations by the government aligns with previous research, revealing a less favorable depiction of translated texts compared to the source texts. Furthermore, the commonality index, a measure of group consensus value, surpasses the typical range, while the certainty index, a measure of confidence, slightly falls below the norm. These findings offer valuable insights for policy considerations while highlighting areas for international communication and understanding improvement.',\n",
       " '(1) Background: Physician rating websites (PRWs) are a rich resource of information where individuals learn other people response to various health problems. The current study aims to investigate and analyze the people top concerns and sentiment dynamics expressed in physician online reviews (PORs). (2) Methods: Text data were collected from four U.S.-based PRWs during the three time periods of 2018, 2019 and 2020. Based on the dynamic topic modeling, hot topics related to different aspects of healthcare were identified. Following the hybrid approach of aspect-based sentiment analysis, the social network of prevailing topics was also analyzed whether people expressed positive, neutral or negative sentiments in PORs. (3) Results: The study identified 30 dominant topics across three different stages which lead toward four key findings. First, topics discussed in Stage III were quite different from the earlier two stages due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Second, based on the keyword co-occurrence analysis, the most prevalent keywords in all three stages were related to the treatment, questions asked by patients, communication problem, patients’ feelings toward the hospital environment, disease symptoms, time spend with patients and different issues related to the COVID-19 (i.e., pneumonia, death, spread and cases). Third, topics related to the provider service quality, hospital servicescape and treatment cost were the most dominant topics in Stages I and II, while the quality of online information regarding COVID-19 and government countermeasures were the most dominant topics in Stage III. Fourth, when zooming into the topic-based sentiments analysis, hot topics in Stage I were mostly positive (joy be the dominant emotion), then negative (disgust be the dominant emotion) in Stage II. Furthermore, sentiments in the initial period of Stage III (COVID-19) were negative (anger be the dominant emotion), then transformed into positive (trust be the dominant emotion) later. The findings also revealed that the proposed method outperformed the conventional machine learning models in analyzing topic and sentiment dynamics expressed in PRWs.

The results of emotion analysis could be used to make further user recommendations for marketing purposes. In our study, we try to understand how users respond to a documentary through YouTube comments. We chose “The lockdown: One month in Wuhan” YouTube documentary, and applied emotion analysis as well as a machine learning approach to the comments. We first cleaned the data and then introduced an emotion analysis based on the statistical characteristics and lexicon combination. After that, we applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling approach to further generate main topics with keywords from the comments and visualized the distribution by visualizing the topics. The result shows trust (22.8%), joy (15.4%), and anticipation (17.6%) are the most prominent emotions dominating the comments. The major three themes, which account for 70% of all comments, are discussing stories about fighting against the virus, medical workers being heroes, and medical workers being respected. Further discussion has been conducted on the changing of different sentiments over time for the ongoing health crisis. This study proves that emotion analysis and LDA topic modeling could be used to generate explanations of users' opinions and feelings about video products, which could support user recommendations in marketing.\",\n",
       " 'Public concern detection provides potential guidance to the authorities for crisis management before or during a pandemic outbreak. Detecting people’s concerns and attention from online social media platforms has been widely acknowledged as an effective approach to relieve public panic and prevent a social crisis. However, detecting concerns in time from massive volumes of information in social media turns out to be a big challenge, especially when sufficient manually labelled data is in the absence during public health emergencies, e.g., COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model to identify people’s concerns and the corresponding relations based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory integrated with Concern Graphs. Except for the sequential features from BERT embeddings, the regional features of tweets can be extracted by the Concern Graph module, which not only benefits the concern detection but also enables our model to be high noise-tolerant. Thus, our model can address the issue of insufficient manually labelled data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model by using both manually labelled tweets and automatically labelled tweets. The experimental results show that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art models on real-world datasets.',\n",

Recent research suggests COVID-19-related discrimination is common in western societies, and the pandemic seems to have exacerbated pre-existing resentment against racial/ethnic minorities/marginalized communities. Reports of racist and xenophobic incidents directed toward Chinese and Asian students, together with personal experiences being culturally discriminated when studying overseas, would have affected students’ motivation for studying abroad. This chapter explores the context of the COVID-19 crisis to critically examine how Chinese and Asian students evaluate the pandemic in relation to their international learning experiences. Our findings suggest many Chinese and Asian students have experienced the “double disturbance” generated from health hazard (COVID-19 infection risk) and symbolic violence (cultural discrimination and racism against Asian students because of different public health prevention behaviours) during the crisis period.

This situation motivates the present study of social media usage patterns, including who contributes to social media around disaster recovery, which recovery activities they contribute to, and how well that participation is sustained over time. Utilising Twitter data from the 2019–20 Australian bushfires, we statistically examined the participation of different groups (citizens, emergency agencies, politicians and others) across categories of disaster recovery activity such as donations & financial support or mental health & emotional support, and observed variations over time. The results showed that user groups differed in how much they contributed on Twitter around different recovery activities, and their levels of participation varied with time. Recovery-related topics also varied significantly with time. These findings are valuable because they increase our understanding of which aspects of disaster recovery currently benefit most from social media and which are relatively neglected, indicating where to focus resources and recovery effort.',\n",

       " 'The current study attempts to compare anti-Asian discourse before and during the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing big data on Quora, one of the most frequently used community-driven knowledge sites. We created two datasets regarding “Asians” and “anti-Asians” from Quora questions and answers between 2010 and 2021. A total of 1,477 questions and 5,346 answers were analyzed, and the datasets were divided into two time periods: before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted machine-learning-based topic modeling and deep-learning-based word embedding (Word2Vec). Before the pandemic, the topics of physical difference and racism were prevalent, whereas, after the pandemic, the topics of hate crime, the need to stop Asian hate crimes, and the need for the Asian solidarity movement emerged. Above all, the semantic similarity between Asian and Black people became closer, while the similarity between Asian people and other racial/ethnic groups was diminished. The emergence of negative and radical language, which increased saliently after the outbreak of the pandemic, and the considerably wider semantic distance between Asian and White people indicates that the relationship between the two races has been weakened. The findings suggest a long-term campaign or education system to reduce racial tensions during the pandemic.',\n",

In this study, we introduce a general methodology to uncover coordinated messaging through an analysis of user posts on Parler. The proposed Coordinating Narratives Framework constructs a user-to-user coordination graph, which is induced by a user-to-text graph and a text-to-text similarity graph. The text-to-text graph is constructed based on the textual similarity of Parler and Twitter posts. We study three influential groups of users in the 6 January 2020 Capitol riots and detect networks of coordinated user clusters that post similar textual content in support of disinformation narratives related to the U.S. 2020 elections. We further extend our methodology to Twitter tweets to identify authors that share the same disinformation messaging as the aforementioned Parler user groups.',\n",
       " 'Guided by moral foundation theory (MFT), this study examines #StopAsianHate messages on Twitter to identify the main narratives surrounding the campaign. It also aims to unpack how moral framing and strategic narratives are related to online engagement size in social justice campaigns. Mixed methods were used to analyze the sampled tweets, including computational approaches based on the extended Moral Foundations Dictionary, structural topic modeling, and hurdle negative binomial regression. The findings show that moral framing is related to a message’s likelihood of receiving likes or retweets on Twitter. Overall, moral framing using virtue values is positively related to the chance of a tweet being retweeted or liked, while vice framing has mixed effects on user engagement. Issue-based framing by zooming in on specific topics helps to avoid zero likes or retweets but does not encourage engagement. We also discuss the implications of these results on how to leverage moral framing and strategic narratives to raise awareness of social injustice.',\n",

Studies that address the intersection of pandemic racism and sexism are lacking and the experiences of Asian women have been neglected. Drawing on interviews with 20 Asian women living in Victoria, Australia, this article aims to bridge the gap between studies of pandemic racism and the issues women faced during the pandemic. The article’s intervention is threefold, we ask: first, how have Asian women in Australia experienced racism? Second, how have their experiences of racism intersected with sexism? Third, how do they make sense of their experiences and thoughts about the future? Our analysis argues three points: first, the lack of attention to Asian women’s experiences of racism obscures the fact that Asian women can encounter racism more than their male counterparts. Second, the lack of attention to how sexism intersects with Asian women’s experiences of racism causes them the inability to make sense of their experiences and prevents them from stopping mistreatment. Third, participants’ reflections show that there is potential for women of colour in general to form coalitions based on sharing intersectionality and offer valuable insights for feminist and antiracist studies and initiatives.',\n",
       " \"Multimodal topic detection is an important social media analysis task with a wide variety of real-world applications. However, modeling data jointly, and inferring their topics, is challenging due to the semantic gaps between different modalities. Our insights are from the psychological findings pretaining to the hierarchical structure in humans' inherent perception of images and texts. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Hierarchical Reasoning Network (MHRN) to perform multimodal inference for topic detection. The images and texts are represented in a hierarchical model named the Multimodal Part-whole Aware Graph (MPAG). MHRN then performs reasoning for topic inference based on three modules, which include a Bottom-Up Aggregation (BUA) module for encoding the hierarchical connections and sibling relations in MPAG, a Top-Down Guidance (TDG) module for enriching features of the nodes in MPAG guided by their parents, and a Bottom-Up Cross Aggregation (BUCA) module for capturing and aggregating the cross-modality cues to achieve effective multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmarks, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach.\",\n",
       " \"Fears of COVID‐19, alongside existing anti‐Asian sentiment, resulted in 11,467 documented hate incidents against Asians/Asian Americans in the United States between March 2020 and March 2022, per the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center. In response, #StopAsianHate and #StopAAPIHate were used on Twitter to increase public awareness. Considering anti‐Asian racism transcends geographic boundaries, we interrogate: how does engagement with these hashtags reflect the transculturality of responses to anti‐Asian racism in a digital environment? We analyzed 920,271 tweets between March 19, 2020, and May 31, 2022, containing either hashtag, defining a “spike” in engagement as any day with >5,000 tweets, and found that of 25 spikes, 11 immediately followed the 2021 Atlanta‐area shootings—however, another 12 spikes were related to South Korean megagroup BTS. We further compare the results of two topic modeling methods, LDA and NMF, to examine how the use of and engagement with these hashtags shift over time primarily due to BTS fans (“ARMY”). This work joins emerging scholarship on race, fandom, and activism through cultural production in order to advance our collective understanding of modern digital activism and racial politics. Overall, we interrogate fandom's contributions to combating anti‐Asian sentiment, build on existing literature exploring the potential for fandoms to advocate for social justice, and argue that the transculturality of BTS, ARMY, and their affective ties represent an opportunity for accessible global discourse about anti‐Asian racism.\",\n",
       " 'Sentiment analysis tools are frequently employed to analyze large amounts of natural language data gathered from social networks and generate valuable insights on public opinion. Research has discovered that these tools tend to be biased against some demographic groups, based on social attributes such as gender, age, and ethnicity. Sentiment classification works dealt with this issue by means of data balancing and algorithmic approaches. However, one crucial limitation of existing methods is the inability to tackle social bias while maintaining satisfactory model performance. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by proposing a sentiment classification method that entails ethnicity-aware algorithmic design. Specifically, our method involves balanced training and a custom ethnicity-aware loss function that leverages ethnicity group information to foster a fair model optimization process. The proposed loss incentivizes the model to iteratively improve accuracy for currently underperforming demographic or social groups, therefore simultaneously decreasing social bias and boosting overall performance. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental evaluation involving a large corpus of user reviews demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, also when compared to popular baselines for sentiment classification.',\n",
       " 'Recent studies have documented increases in anti-Asian hate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet relatively little is known about how anti-Asian content on social media, as well as positive messages to combat the hate, have varied over time. In this study, we investigated temporal changes in the frequency of anti-Asian and counter-hate messages on Twitter during the first 16 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the Twitter Data Collection Application Programming Interface, we queried all tweets from January 30, 2020 to April 30, 2021 that contained specific anti-Asian (e.g.,#chinavirus, #kungflu)and counter-hate (e.g.,#hateisavirus)keywords. From this initial data set, we extracted a random subset of 1,000 Twitter users who had used one or more anti-Asian or counter-hate keywords. For each of these users, we calculated the total number of anti-Asian and counter-hate keywords posted each month. Latent growth curve analysis revealed that the frequency of anti-Asian keywords fluctuated over time in a curvilinear pattern, increasing steadily in the early months and then decreasing in the later months of our data collection. In contrast, the frequency of counter-hate keywords remained low for several months and then increased in a linear manner. Significant between-user variability in both anti-Asian and counter-hate content was observed, highlighting individual differences in the generation of hate and counter-hate messages within our sample. Together, these findings begin to shed light on longitudinal patterns of hate and counter-hate on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

To gain a comprehensive understanding of social media users’ attention and reactions to racial injustice during this unprecedented time, the current study explores and compares the discursive characteristics of Twitter discussions of these two movements: their volume changes, word diversities, and moral and emotional sentiments. By analyzing the text of approximately 5 million tweets from April 2020 to April 2021 using a dictionary-based word count method, this research showed that compared to #BlackLivesMatter, #StopAsianHate was less diverse, more morally charged, and less positive in emotional sentiment. Additionally, #StopAsianHate contained stronger moral emotions than #BlackLivesMatter. The study connects these distinct characteristics to the two movements’ differences in their objectives, progress and participants’ demographics and provides implications for effective antiracist activism on social media.',\n",

       " 'The rapid expansion of social media has notably transformed political communication, with politicians and activists increasingly adopting multimedia formats to disseminate their ideologies and policy proposals. This transformation poses a significant risk of propaganda through coordinated campaigns that leverage template-based imagery to spread political messages. To tackle this challenge, our research focuses on developing a detection framework for identifying political images crafted from similar templates, which are a common tool in such propaganda efforts. During a national referendum held in 2021 in Taiwan, we collected visual content from various social networks and implemented a hybrid approach that combines object recognition, textual analysis, and pixel-level information. This methodology is specifically designed to detect patterns and similarities within propaganda images, enabling us to trace and analyze the potentially manipulative content. Our hybrid feature combination technique has demonstrated superior performance compared to several established baseline methods in identifying template-based images. This advancement in detection technology not only enhances the efficiency of researchers studying political communication but also serves as a crucial tool in uncovering and understanding the mechanisms behind potential political propaganda and coordinated efforts to shape public opinion on social media platforms.',\n",

Using nationally representative data from the “Dynamics of Social Life during COVID-19” survey, we show that these intersections affect subjective experiences of racism among young and older Asian Americans across various ethnic groups in the U.S. Younger Asian women report the highest levels of worry about racism, with this concern decreasing with age. In contrast, older Asian men worry more than younger men. Asian women also reported more instances of unfair treatment and discrimination, while Asian men reported higher instances of racial violence. Our findings reveal that anti-Asian racism is a multifaceted phenomenon shaped by intersections of gender, age, and ethnicity. We discuss existing obstacles and potential pathways to building panethnic solidarity among Asians across cultures.',\n",

Based on data analysis of netizen’ comments on Twitter and Weibo (a Chinese social media platform similar to Twitter), we used data mining algorithm to identify the primary topics of interest and examine the evolution of public opinion. The findings indicate that attention to incident resulting in war damage has a negative impact on social stability through a feedback loop. Netizen on Twitter and Weibo were primarily focused on “Flood” “Crisis” “Charge” and “Help” topics. Among them, Twitter was more popular in terms of public opinion and had faster dissemination speed. “Crisis” and “Charge” were more likely to generate public opinion risks. The potential impact of war damage on social stability is noteworthy, and social stability is largely dependent on the attention level of netizen.',\n",

In two large-sample survey experiments, we examine how members of the public perceive research ethics in studies of racial and ethnic politics that leverage public and administrative records, and provide practical recommendations for scholars using these data sets in their research. By highlighting this growing gap, we hope to spark conversation regarding ethics as the academic community confronts these dramatic advances in data collection and statistical analysis.',\n",
       " 'While the literature has established that immigration opinions among African Americans are frequently driven by economic anxieties, less is known about how this co-exists with other factors. I argue that race and distribution of foreign-born immigrants at the local level may be important additional factors in determining African American immigration restrictionist sentiment. OLS regressions were run with robustness checks. Results suggest that African Americans living in counties with high proportions of Black or Asian immigrants may lead to more positive immigration sentiments. I find the opposite for those in high Latino foreign-born counties. Additional results with interactions show the limitations of group competition as a mechanism for this relationship. These findings have implications for the future of intergroup relations and suggest further examining the diverse identities of immigrants and their effects on Black political opinion. As the demographics profile of immigrant groups in the US continues to diversify, it is imperative that we continue to investigate how the increasing ethnic diversity of Black America may be disrupting scholarly knowledge and expectations for the future of intergroup relations in America.',\n",

This research chose qualitative case study approach which uses the Asian hate as the case. Content analysis was adopted to analyse Instagram posts of eight social media influencers and the comments of their followers in relation to those posts. I have found two dominant tactics, which are Solution and Campaign-promotion, and two supplement tactics, including Supplication and Association. In accordance with these tactics, the audience revealed five themes of responses: Educated, Feelings, Support, Resonance and Seeking reasons. The analysis revealed Solution as one of the leading tactics that will trigger people to feel educated and be supportive of the campaign posts, while Campaign-promotion will provoke Resonance, Reasons seeking and feeling Educated.

While existing literature provides insights into supporting scholars from marginalized communities in research and publishing, there remains limited study and public awareness of diverse representation on editorial boards in school psychology. To address this gap, three studies in 2023 evaluated major journal boards in the United States. Study 1 analyzed 636 names collected from board websites to estimate the representation of scholars of color, women, and gender minorities. Study 2 surveyed board members to estimate the representation of scholars of color, women, gender minorities, sexual minorities, scholars with disabilities, and multilingual scholars. Study 3 employed a survey of editors. Findings revealed that scholars of color composed 23% to 29% of board members as of 2023. Women composed 56% to 61%, gender minority groups composed 0.2% to 0.4%, sexual minority groups composed 11%, scholars with disabilities composed 23%, and multilingual scholars composed 16% of editorial board members. One-third of board members had two or more intersecting marginalized identities. Scholars of color made up at least a quarter of members at each service level (eg, editor, associate editor, and board member), and representation of scholars of color ranged from 9% to 56% by journal. The variation in marginalized scholars’ representation across service levels and journals underscores the need to address barriers to inclusion, tokenism, and professional and social exclusion affecting recruitment, retention, and representation of diverse scholars on school psychology editorial boards.',\n",

In New Narratives on the Peopling of America, editors T. Alexander Aleinikoff and Alexandra Délano Alonso present an extraordinary collection of original essays that reshape our understanding of the peopling of the United States. This thought-provoking volume goes beyond conventional accounts of immigration by reexamining narratives about foreign-born populations in the United States. It situates them as part of a larger story of forced displacement and dispossession that needs to include indigenous people, enslaved persons, deported and returned migrants, and those residing in territories and foreign nations acquired by the United States. The diverse range of contributors—which include academics, journalists, artists, legal scholars, and activists—confront complex topics such as migration, racial justice, tribal sovereignty, and the pursuit of equality. As nationalism, globalization, and economic challenges reshape the social and political landscape, this timely volume calls for a reevaluation and reconstruction of national narratives of belonging. Challenging nativist tropes and offering broader understandings of collective history, this pathbreaking book centers issues of race and dispossession in the story of the American people.

       " 'This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of counterspeech strategies employed on Twitter in response to anti-Asian hate during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research delves into the communicative strategies, emotional tones, and geospatial distribution of counterspeech, specifically focusing on its effectiveness in the United States. A supervised machine learning was employed to classify counterspeech tweets and counterspeech strategies based on empirical typology. By analyzing 106,388 tweets associated with the hashtag# StopAsianHate collected from November 2021 to May 2022, this research provides insights into the varied effectiveness of counterspeech strategies. The analysis revealed that though counterspeakers were using more negative tones in counterspeech tweets, the tweets with visual media and positive emotional tone received more engagement on Twitter through retweets and favorites compared to those with a negative or neutral tone. This study also breaks new ground by recognizing that higher level of racial diversity does not facilitate higher level of counterspeech against hate speech and hate crime. Additionally, this study highlights the varying degrees of participation in counterspeech across different ethnic groups within Asian American community and underscores the importance of tailored strategies in addressing hate speech. Recognizing this distinction proved essential in crafting evidence-based guidance for community and individual interventions while fostering support from allies of diverse racial backgrounds.',\n",
       " 'Since the outbreak of Covid-19, anti-Asian racist sentiment has spread on social media (Martin & Yoon, 2021). The present study investigates how social media may play a role in fighting against anti-Asian racism. This qualitative research utilized AsianCrit (Kiang, 2016) as the theoretical framework. Public data were collected from major social media platforms—Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. This research applied netnography analysis (Kozinets, 2015), thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2019), and critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1995) techniques to collect, interpret, and discuss the data. The findings reveal that the responses on social media platforms were diverse, ranging from heartfelt expressions of support to critical discussions about systemic issues, and that supportive posts outweighed the non-supportive and neutral posts. Social media played a crucial role in amplifying the voices of those advocating against Asian hate, fostering community, and raising awareness about the issue. However, posts on these platforms showcased the challenges of addressing such complex and deeply rooted societal problems. Data analysis confirmed that hatred towards Asians is not just a product of the pandemic; it is in part the result of systemic bias and the influence of White supremacy. The researcher concludes that to address the issue of hatred towards Asians, it is crucial to educate the general public about Asian history, not only at the societal level, but most importantly, early on with students during their K-12 education.',\n",

As a case study, the Covid-19 pandemic is assessed, where second-generation individuals were faced with increased discrimination. The study explores the impact of parenting behavior, particularly the phenomenon of ‘’tiger parenting’’, which emphasizes academic excellence and success but does not always promote integration into Dutch society.‘’Othering’’is introduced to describe the treatment of individuals with immigrant backgrounds as different, resulting in challenges to their sense of belonging.

       " 'This research examined whether inter-disadvantaged group allyship is a function of ingroup projection onto the disadvantaged group category. In two studies, I assessed whether Black Americans are more willing to engage in collective action on behalf of their group and less willing to do so on behalf of disadvantaged outgroups to the extent that ingroup projection occurred. In Study 1 (N= 171), projection was a predictor of willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of the ingroup, but not on behalf of two disadvantaged outgroups. Study 2 (N= 306) replicated and extended the results of Study 1 by showing that inter-disadvantaged group allyship emerges by way of projection but only when competitive victimhood is low. This research demonstrates not only that ingroup projection onto a disadvantaged group category occurs but that this projection has implications not only for collective action on behalf of the ingroup but also inter-disadvantaged group allyship.',\n",
       " 'In this dissertation, I investigate the complex relationships between Asian American identity (pan-ethnic, ethnic, gender) and political participation (electoral and non-electoral). I utilize a multi-method approach with both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to understand these relationships. In chapter 1, using the National Asian American Survey in 2008, I analyzed the effects of socioeconomic status, political efficacy, social connectedness, immigrant generation, pan-ethnic identity, and ethnic identity on both electoral and non-electoral political participation. Results were supportive of previous research and hypotheses with a key highlight of pan-ethnic and ethnic identity. Pan-ethnic identity was positively related to electoral political participation and ethnic identity was positively related to non-electoral political participation. To further investigate this relationship between identity and political participation, in chapters 2 and 3 I conducted a study interviewing 13 Asian American women leaders in political non-profit organizations across the United States. In chapter 2, I found that respondents utilized their ethnic and pan-ethnic identities to motivate and justify their careers in politics and leadership. Specifically, their understanding and connection to their family’s immigration stories were critical to why they decided to study race or politics and eventually become leaders in the political arena. In chapter 3, I investigated themes of gender and race (intersectional) identity of Asian American women in how they navigated their current positions and work. I found that Asian American women, although explicitly in leadership positions, still felt constraints of gendered expectations and stereotypes both from within and outside their community. However, respondents felt a need to push on for future generations of Asian American women and to persevere despite any backlash. This dissertation will contribute to the gap in both political participation and Asian American identity literature and provide richness to understanding of how to mobilize an important and quickly growing racial group in the United States.',\n",
       " \"With the rapid advancement of technology in the 21st century, the online world and social media have created a contemporary environment and enriching channels and platforms for which human connection, communication, and marketing can all take place. Recently, the concept of social impact campaign marketing (SICM) has resurfaced to capture the macro-level impact social media has on SICM as a phenomenon. Existent research on social impact campaign marketing lies within the realm of traditional marketing, and centres on the antiquated concept of SICM being a strategy, primarily adopted by for-profit businesses. Thus, this research paper is devoted to acknowledging this gap in literature through exploring the contemporary marketing environment, with specific examination of social media's role and impact on SICM, exceeding the scope of traditional SICM approaches and adopting a broadened perspective to appease non-for-profit (NFP) organisations and activist campaigners through our research also. Specifically, this dissertation seeks to determine the variety of ways in which social media acts as a platform to efficiently facilitate contemporary SICM.\",\n",
       " \"Context: The broader education community has urgently called for increased antiracism education research to help address racial issues, such as problematic attitudes and microaggressions imbedded within Predominately White Institutions (PWI) of higher education. Currently, there is limited research utilizing racial bias interventions for higher education STEMM audiences and those studies that have are often limited to group workshops, small samples, and pre/post survey designs. Furthermore, most studies on racial attitudes have assessed limited cognitive, affective, and behavioral attitudes, suggesting a need for empirical studies that examine the effects of interventions across a wider range of attitudes. Using a mixed-method experimental design, I examined how a solo-player, online, gamified racial bias intervention designed for STEMM audiences affected the cognitive, affective, and behavioral racial attitudes and during-learning processes of students at a PWI. Specifically I asked:(1) What are the effects of a digital game-based racial microaggression intervention on students’ racial attitudes?(2) Are the effects of the intervention affected by during-learning behaviors and emotions? Design/Methods: I conducted a randomized experiment with 609 undergraduate students that were stratified by race and gender. Students completed a pre/post survey with multiple cognitive, affective, and behavioral racial attitude measures, and engaged in a think-emote aloud while being screen recorded playing a 45 to 60-minute online, gamified, racial bias intervention called Fair Play. I used the previous coding schemes from a pilot study and conducted path analyses to examine the effects of the Fair Play intervention and during-learning processes across 23 cognitive, affective, and behavioral racial attitudes. Results: Results revealed nine small to large statistically significant effects of Fair Play across students’ cognitive, affective, and behavioral racial attitudes. More specifically, students became more confused about types of microaggressions, perceived some aspects of the racial climate more and less positively, and their intentions to behave as a racial ally changed. Additional path analyses also revealed students’ self-regulatory processes during Fair Play had small to moderate suppressor and enhancement effects on students’ racial attitudes. Findings from this study provide evidence that despite students having poor self-regulatory learning and coping strategies, a single session of an immersive, gamified racial bias intervention has immediate positive and negative effects on different aspects of students' racial attitudes. Conclusion: Fair Play is a solo-player, online, gamified racial bias intervention that provides an engaging, novel, low-cost, and low-stakes environment to teach students about the sensitive topic of racial bias. Our studies provide empirical evidence that playing Fair Play has small to large effects on cognitive, affective, and behavioral racial attitudes but is more likely to affect students’ perceptions of the racial climate and racially-motivated behaviors than other attitudes. Triangulating the pre/post survey results with during-learning process data has also provided evidence to better understand the role of the learning process in supporting racial attitude changes with a serious game. Insights from the studies provide a better understanding of how self-regulated learning theories apply to the learning and teaching of racialized topics within a digital learning environment and can help support the development of more effective racial bias interventions.\",\n",

We, four Vietnamese graduate students from different disciplines and educational systems, come together to discuss the #StopAsianHate movement during the global pandemic, which lead us to investigate the larger issue of identity and systemic racism. This study is grounded by deconstructionism to de-essentialize the concreted dichotomy of the original white identity and the deficient Asian identity; thus, we reveal the diversity in a company called “Asian.” Our study begins with a digital visual approach to analyze online photographs regarding the #StopAsianHate movement, which broadens our understanding of the complexity of racism in different contexts. We then write letters to one another to share our reflections, personal stories, and/or strategies to strengthen us to counter the discrimination we saw online or experienced in real life. These insights are synthesized into a unifying letter to promote actions to develop collaborative learning and connections in a time of turbulence.

It was believed that this change would create a new level of conflict for the big civilizations-the cultural level (Huntington, 1993). Starting from the predictions of the past this study follows the impact of technology and globalization on the clashes of civilizations. We argue in this paper that technology and globalization influenced the development of politics and cultures, and pushed them towards toleration. The study analyzes the change of society at both macro and micro levels. For that, we concentrate on the case of Europe and China. Consequently we understand that at a macro level the liberal democratic societies are engines that sustain cultural blending because of their policies oriented towards cultural equality to avoid any economic and political pressures of the economic groups (Carens, 1997). At the opposite pole, we have the example of China, which represents the model of a state which normally would get into a clash of civilizations, but its economic interdependence does not allow to maintain its power if separating from the global market. At a micro level, we analyze the impact of technology and the neo-liberal markets on individuals. As a result, we highlight that technology, access to information, and the capacity of different nations to connect influenced social thinking. We found that the way the neoliberal market has influenced people has brought people closer instead of clashing.',\n",

Through focus groups with Vietnamese Americans across two generations and several geographic locations, we explore the complexities of misinformation within one such immigrant community. Findings highlight how a prevalence of intergenerational divides in political information seeking, lasting historical and political traumas of immigration, and language barriers underpin the saliency and impact of misinformation for Vietnamese Americans. Further, we explore how misinformation impacts political engagement, highlighting the consequences of misinformation at a familial and community-level.

In this study, we investigate how mass social media users perceive the recent rise of AI frameworks such as ChatGPT. We collect a total of 33,912 comments in 388 unique subreddits spanning from November 30, 2022 to June 8, 2023 using a list of AI-related keywords. We employ a combination of thematic and sentiment analysis, using advanced natural language processing techniques. Specifically, we use BERTopic to uncover the major themes regarding AI on Reddit. Our findings indicate that technology-focused subreddits primarily discuss the technical dimensions of AI, while non-technical subreddits more often address societal impacts, such as job displacement concerns. The disparity in focus between subreddits suggests a gap in the public understanding of AI. We leverage GPT-3.5 with zero-shot prompting and LIWC to analyze the sentiment and perception of AI among individual users. Through a comprehensive sentiment and emotion analysis, we discover that tech-centric communities exhibit greater polarization compared to non-tech communities when discussing AI topics. This suggests that individuals with a deeper understanding or familiarity with AI technologies might have more divided opinions, possibly reflecting a mix of optimism about technological advancements and skepticism about potential impacts. This research contributes to our broader understanding of public opinion surrounding artificial intelligence.',\n",

The top five common symptoms extracted in the early period were coughing (57%), fever (55%), loss of sense of smell (41%), headache (40%), and sore throat (40%). During the Delta period, these symptoms remained as the top five symptoms with percent authors reporting symptoms reduced to half or fewer than the early period. During the Omicron period, loss of sense of smell was reported less while sore throat was reported more.

We analyzed COVID-19 vaccine side effect-related discussions from Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube, each of which represents a different type of the platform, and found thematic and emotional differences across platforms. Thematic analysis usingk-means clustering algorithm identified seven clusters in each platform.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination debate sparked controversial debates on social media platforms such as Twitter, which can lead to serious consequences for public health. What determines anti-vax attitudes is an important question for understanding the source of the campaigns and mitigating the misinformation spread. Compared with other countries, Türkiye differentiates itself with high vaccination rates and lack of political support for anti-vaxxers despite its highly polarized political system. Analyzing Turkish Twittersphere, we explore several mechanisms capturing content production and behaviors of accounts within the pro- and anti-vax segments in online vaccine-related discussions. Our findings indicate there is no relation between political stance and anti-vaccine attitude. Both supporters of vaccination (pro-vaxxers) and opponents (anti-vaxxers) can be found across the political spectrum. Moreover, linguistic differences reveal that anti-vaxxers employ more emotional language, while pro-vaxxers express more skepticism. Notably, automated accounts are less prevalent leading to difficulty in assessing genuine support for vaccines, while anti-vaccine bots produce slightly more content. These findings have crucial implications for vaccine policy, emphasizing the importance of understanding diverse language patterns and beliefs among anti-vaxxers and pro-vaxxers to develop effective communication strategies at the national level.',\n",

The goal of this article is to use Reddit’s location-based subreddits to look at country-level differences in attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine passports. We used sentiment analysis and latent topic modelling on textual data obtained from 18 Reddit communities concentrating on COVID-19 vaccine passports from 1 January 2021 to 28 February 2022 to study COVID-19 vaccine passports–related discussion on Reddit. To discover changes in sentiment and latent topics, 11,168 comments were aggregated and examined by month. The number of comments on postings from country-specific subreddits was positively proportional to the number of new COVID-19 cases reported each day. The more subjective expressions and positive/negative interpretations occurred after July 2021. Communities indicated more positive sentiment than negative sentiment towards vaccine passports–related topics, according to polarity analysis. Topic modelling found that community members were concerned about a variety of concerns related to their socioeconomic status. Throughout the topic modelling, keywords suggesting people’s privacy concerns and acceptance of various COVID-19 control methods were found. The use of public opinion and topic modelling to analyse vaccine passports could help with important global health informatics concerns associated with their socioeconomic status.',\n",

Machine learning methods were used to analyze Google reviews of six COVID-19 mass vaccination centers in Berlin from December 2020 to December 2021. 3647 user online reviews were included in the analysis. Of these, 89% (3261/3647) were positive according to user rating (four to five of five stars). A total of 85% (2740/3647) of all reviews contained text. Topic modeling of the reviews containing text identified five optimally latent topics, and keyword extraction identified 47 salient keywords. The most important themes were organization, friendliness/responsiveness, and patient flow/wait time. Key interactions for users of vaccination centers included waiting, scheduling, transit, and the vaccination itself. Keywords connected to scheduling and efficiency, such as “appointment” and “wait”, were most prominent in negative reviews. Over time, the average rating score decreased from 4.7 to 4.1, and waiting and duration became more salient keywords. Overall, mass vaccination centers appear to be positively perceived, yet users became more critical over the one-year period of the pandemic vaccination campaign observed.

We set up four categories of attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines, and used a big data analysis tool to code and manually checked the coding results to complete the content analysis. The results showed that 45.14% of the Weibo posts (n= 1542) supported the COVID-19 vaccine, 12.97% were neutral, and 7.26% were doubtful, which indicated that the public did not question the vaccine’s effectiveness due to the breakthrough cases in Nanjing. There were 66.47% posts that reflected significant negative emotions. Among these, 50.44% of posts with negative emotions were directed towards the media, 25.07% towards the posting users, and 11.51% towards the public, which indicated that the negative emotions were not directed towards the COVID-19 vaccine. External sources outside the vaccine might cause vaccine hesitancy.

Findings indicate that healthcare workers, commonly framed as pandemic victims (e.g. as subjects of others’ decisions and behavior) or philanthropists, were given less attention than patients, whose victimization was the dominant focus of the discourse. Posts were commonly individualistic, comments leaned collectivistic, while the entire discourse was largely negative in valence.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a large amount of dubious information being shared online. In Belgium, a crisis emerged during the pandemic when a soldier (Jürgen Conings) went missing with stolen weaponry after threatening politicians and virologists. This case created further division and polarization in online discussions. In this paper, we develop a methodology to study the potential of coordinated spread of incorrect information online. We combine network science and content analysis to infer and study the social network of users discussing the case, the news websites shared by those users, and their narratives. Additionally, we examined indications of bots or coordinated behavior among the users. Our findings reveal the presence of distinct communities within the discourse. Major news outlets, conspiracy theory websites, and anti-vax platforms were identified as the primary sources of (dis)information sharing. We also detected potential coordinated behavior and bot activity, indicating possible attempts to manipulate the discourse. We used the rapid semantic similarity network for the analysis of text, but our approach can be extended to the analysis of images, videos, and other types of content. These results provide insights into the role of social media in shaping public opinion during times of crisis and underscore the need for improved strategies to detect and mitigate disinformation campaigns and online discourse manipulation.

Despite this dis-parity in the dissemination of anti- and pro-vaccine posts, linguistic features that facilitate or inhibit the propagation of vaccine-related content remain less known. Moreover, most prior machine-learning algorithms classified social-media posts into binary categories (e.g., misinformation or not) and have rarely tackled a higher-order classification task based on divergent perspectives about vaccines (e.g., anti-vaccine, pro-vaccine, and neutral). Our objectives are (1) to identify sets of linguistic features that facilitate and inhibit the propagation of vaccine-related content and (2) to compare whether anti-vaccine, pro-vaccine, and neutral tweets contain either set more frequently than the others. To achieve these goals, we collected a large set of social media posts (over 120 million tweets) between Nov. 15 and Dec. 15, 2021, coinciding with the Omicron variant surge. A two-stage framework was developed using a fine-tuned BERT classifier, demonstrating over 99 and 80 percent accuracy for binary and ternary classification. Finally, the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count text analysis tool was used to count linguistic features in each classified tweet. Our regression results show that anti-vaccine tweets are propagated (i.e., retweeted), while pro-vaccine tweets garner passive endorsements (i.e., favorited). Our results also yielded the two sets of linguistic features as facilitators and inhibitors of the propagation of vaccine-related tweets. Finally, our regression results show that anti-vaccine tweets tend to use the facilitators, while pro-vaccine counterparts employ the inhibitors.

Specifically, we examine how individuals in different states engage in information searching and sharing about monkeypox (using Google Trends and Reddit) and whether/how these online activities are associated with the geographical differences in confirmed cases across states. Our research questions are 1) with each state as the unit, does the ranking of search interest/frequency match the ranking of locally confirmed cases? 2) what monkeypox-related topics and queries were searched the most in Google Trends? 3) how much do individuals use Reddit to share their concerns and experiences about monkeypox? Preliminary results revealed a mismatch between the rank of monkeypox searching frequency and the rank of locally confirmed cases - individuals who reside in relatively higher-risk areas do not necessarily engage in more searching. Using Google Trends, we found the top 3 \"monkeypox\" related topics are: Monkeypox, Medical sign, and Vaccine.

Thus, this study has focused on news media, an important source of vaccination-related dissemination, and aimed to investigate how different presentations of news influence an individual’s COVID-19 vaccine intention. Moreover, whether the cultural values individuals possess would influence the persuasive effects of news information was also considered in our study. A web-based experiment among 310 participants employing 2 (news framing: rights frame vs. obligation frame)× 2 (argument quality: high argument quality vs. low argument quality)× 2 (individual–collective orientation: individualism vs. collectivism) design was conducted in this study. Data were analyzed through a series of analyses of variance (ANOVAs) in SPSS 26. The results show that argument quality had a significant positive impact on individuals’ psychological acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. The results also show that the rights framework was significantly more persuasive than the obligation framework. Furthermore, for individualistic individuals, news information with high argument quality and a rights frame was the most persuasive. These findings may help guide the writing of news, thereby improving vaccine uptake, enhancing the public’s health literacy, and facilitating the implementation of vaccination policies during and after a pandemic.',\n",

The aim was to facilitate decision-making for psychosocial rehabilitation.Materials and MethodsWe utilized natural language processing techniques, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis, on a dataset consisting of more than 38,000 topics, comments, and posts collected from a subreddit dedicated to the experiences of people who tested positive for COVID-19. In this longitudinal exploratory analysis, we studied the dynamics between the most dominant topics and subjects’ emotional states over an 18-month period.ResultsOur findings highlight the evolution of the textual and sentimental status of major topics discussed by COVID survivors over an extended period of time during the pandemic. We particularly studied pre- and post-vaccination eras as a turning point in the timeline of the pandemic. The results show that not only does the relevance of topics change over time, but the emotions attached to them also vary. Major social events, such as the administration of vaccines or enforcement of nationwide policies, are also reflected through the discussions and inquiries of social media users. In particular, the emotional state (i.e., sentiments and polarity of their feelings) of those who have experienced COVID personally.DiscussionCumulative societal knowledge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the patterns with which people discuss their experiences, concerns, and opinions. The subjects’ emotional state with respect to different topics was also impacted by extraneous factors and events, such as vaccination.ConclusionBy mining major topics, sentiments, and trajectories demonstrated in COVID-19 survivors’ interactions on Reddit, this study contributes to the emerging body of scholarship on COVID-19 survivors’ mental health outcomes, providing insights into the design of mental health support and rehabilitation services for COVID-19 survivors.',\n",

Data cover a period of eight months (July 2021–February 2022) and were collected through attending protests and through selecting past speeches of anti-vaccination protests that are available online in the form of shared videos. The data were analysed in terms of the main topics, the implicit and explicit influences/resources, and the linguistic strategies contained in these speeches. Results reveal that four are the main topics included in these speeches: government/governors/politicians, vaccines/vaccination/(un)vaccinated, measures, and children/parents. In addition, the influences/resources of these speeches derive from the political, religious, social, scientific, and historical spheres/domains, while the linguistic strategies used by speakers involve representations of processes and social actors which include – and exclude thereof – certain actions and ‘doers’ in specific ways. Overall, this project bridges the gap caused by both the absence of studies on onsite anti-vaccination protests and the very limited consideration of anti-vaccination discourse in Greek-speaking contexts.',\n",

Since there are limited researches of CDA on the vaccine discourse in the media (how the vaccine is portrayed), this study aims to contribute to the researches in CDA about Covid-19 vaccine discourse. Fairclough's (1995) three-dimensional critical discourse analysis was utilised as a foundational framework to investigate the amount to which power is linguistically expressed persuasively in every discourse of different media genres using particular lexical, rhetorical, and pragmatic methods. A qualitative approach was used to analyse the selected data (two discourses from each media type). The findings revealed that the governments, through media, had used linguistic features to persuade people's minds, convincing them to take the vaccine as the only solution. The ethical appeal, cultural, societal and religious is very well generated in the discourse of both media genres.\",\n",
       " 'Distinguishing between information and disinformation is an ever growing issue. The dramatic structure of a conspiracy theory easily captures a large audience and with the advent of social media, this disinformation can spread at an ever growing rate. This is especially true with the infodemic following the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, where there was a drastic increase in Covid-19 related misinformation on social media. When misinformation replaces fact, some people will inevitably follow borderline dangerous advice. This could unfortunately be seen in the ivermection issue where people injected this substance in hope of preventing/curing a Covid-19 infection. This is why finding patterns in disinformation that distinguishes it from facts would allow us to take measures against the spread of conspiracy theories. We have found patterns in our dataset suggesting that there is a significant difference in the language patterns for terms relating to conspiracy theories, and non-conspiratorial terms. We find that the sentiment of conspiracy theories is very volatile when compared to that of non-conspiratorial terms which follow a more neutral pattern in terms of sentiment. Suggesting that the language usage in a post can be used as a factor when determining the credibility of its content. We also find that conspiracy theories tend to see a drastic increase in mentions when previously being relatively low in mentions. The result of this thesis could therefore be used as a start for developing tools and processes which would seek to combat the spread of conspiracy theories and limit the potential harm that could come from them.',\n",

This research examines the role of social media messages on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Fako Division, Southwest Region of Cameroon. The Agenda Setting Theory was used to support the body of literature. The study adopted a quantitative approach and the survey method. Data were collected from students at Biaka University, Tiko University, Higher Institute of Professional Studies, and final-year students in the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Buea. Findings revealed that social media messages have significantly enhanced students’ knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines. The result, t (df = 258) = -9.9, p p = 0.001), was statistically significant at a 0.05 level with a 95% confidence interval. Descriptively, 77.2% of the students affirmed that social media has enhanced their knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines. Equally, the results disclosed that social media messages have significantly influenced students’ attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, t (df = 258) = 9.6, p p = 0.001) and promoted vaccine-hesitant behaviour among students, t (df = 258) = 10.4, p p = 0.001). Furthermore, the students significantly (p = 0.001) affirmed that COVID-19 preventive measures like regular hand washing, use of hand sanitizers, wearing of face masks, and social distancing effectively mitigate the spread of the pandemic. To boost vaccine confidence and acceptance, the researchers recommend that the government of Cameroon should organise intensive COVID-19 health campaigns in Higher Learning Institutions to educate students on the importance of vaccines.',\n",

Nowadays, with an estimated 4.5 billion users worldwide, social media data offer an opportunity for near real-time analysis of large bodies of text related to disease outbreaks and vaccination. This study investigated and compared public discourse related to COVID-19 vaccines expressed on two popular social media platforms, Reddit and Twitter. Approximately 9.5 million Tweets and 70 thousand Reddit comments were analyzed from dates January 1, 2020, to March 1, 2022, and analyzed through topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and semantic network analysis. Sentiment analysis through the fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model revealed that even though Twitter content was overall more negative than content expressed on Reddit, relatively similar changes in sentiment occurred among users of both online platforms. Reversals in sentiment trends typically occurred within relative proximity to events such as vaccine development news, vaccine release, frequent discussion of side-effects, the discovery of new variants, and pandemic fatigue. Topic modeling and semantic network analysis provided insight into how public discourse related to COVID-19 and vaccinations, misinformation, and vaccine hesitancy evolved over 26 months. Though misinformation and mention of conspiracy theories were detected with the analysis, the occurrence of both was less frequent than expected. This work provides a framework that could be scaled and utilized by public health officials to monitor disease outbreaks in near real-time in large communities as well as smaller local groups. Hopefully, the results from this study will help to guide and facilitate the implementation of targeted digital interventions among vaccine-hesitant populations and provide insights to public health officials to inform decision-making and effective policy development.',\n",

       " 'The article is devoted to the analysis of vaccination discourses as ways of constructing and transforming social reality. Vaccination is considered, firstly, as a direction of state policy in the social and medical sphere; secondly, as a basis for realizing a legitimizing identity or constructing a resistance identity. Based on M. Castells’ concept of identity and the theory of discourse by E. Laclos and C. Mouffe, two discourses are distinguished that coexist in an antagonistic struggle–\" for\"(support) and\" against\"(resistance) to vaccination. The state is the main subject of the formation of the discourse for vaccination, constructing a legitimizing identity. The nodal points of this discourse are analyzed in the sphere of the regulatory law, particularly, in the Roadmap for COVID-19 Vaccines. This discourse is constructed on the nodal points of inclusion (being vaccinated means\" being included\" and having access to certain benefits), trust (in health care system and the vaccines), safety (both on the individual and national levels). The discourse\" against\" vaccination, which is the basis for the formation of the resistance identity, is characterized by the absence of the main subject of its construction. The channels of its objectification through which the media act becomes more significant than the status of the discourse constructing subjects. The nodal points of this discourse are analyzed in the context of new media–Ukrainian-language publications of the online media in Ukraine–as a space of the\" culture of freedom\" that creates the basis for the transition from mass communications to mass self-communications. Such discourse is constructed on interconnected nodal points of distrust and unsafety (the formation of scientific and medical doubts, discrediting the quality of vaccines, direct or indirect articulation of the sign of death). This study has recorded the exceptional significance of distrust as a point of catalyzing other nodal points and signs. The construction of discourses of support and resistance to vaccination occurs according to different algorithms: if, in the field of discourse struggle, the articulation of the point of distrust is sufficient for the dominance of the discourse of resistance, then for the discourse of support for vaccination it is necessary to construct various signs and nodal points to reproduce the positions of its dominance. It is obviously that public policy should provide for the meaningful integration of the nodal points of security and trust, as well as the construction of a new nodal point of rallying, which should be articulated not only in the legal framework, but also in the plurality of discourse fields that form the discourse of support for vaccination (speech officials, communications from the responsible authorities and generally within the vaccination information campaign).',\n",

First, the indicators are weighted using spherical fuzzy entropy. Then, the alternatives are ranked using spherical fuzzy ARAS. The alternatives are also ranked with the spherical fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution methodology. The main contribution of this study is that it would help investors to take the right actions to increase the performance of insurtech investments without incurring high costs. Another important novelty is that a new fuzzy decision-making model is proposed to solve this problem. The results of the two models are quite similar, proving the validity and coherency of the findings. It is found that pricing is the most critical factor that affects the performance of insurtech investments. Insurtech companies are required to make accurate pricing by conducting risk analyses to increase their profits and minimize their risks.

       " \"Financial technologies or fintech have changed the way financial services are provided and have replaced traditional financial services. Large investments have been made in fintechs but there is a gap between service providers and consumers. Due to the high diversity and speed of change in this field, people still do not understand and resist the new financial system, while citizens are the ultimate target of a wide range of fintech services. Successful transition requires providing opportunities for citizens to participate, which is expressed with the concept of financial citizenship. The present study aims to achieve a clear understanding of the citizenship dimension in the transition to fintech. Therefore, based on the interpretive paradigm and qualitative research method, and with the inductive approach and the use Grounded theory, it has analyzed financial citizenship and promoted social capital in the Fintech transition. In this regard, with Purposive sampling and Sampling snowballs, have been interviewed with 15 experts in the field of fintech. The findings show that factors such as technological pressure at the international level and the weakness of the traditional financial system have stimulated the transition to fintech, but citizens' distrust has led to Lack of acceptance of fintech. Bridging this gap requires the formation of a participatory approach to financial citizenship in order to inform citizens and promote social capital to provide conditions for citizen participation in the position of customer, feedback provider or financial services requester. In this way, it will lead to the expansion of the FinTech startup market, financing, definition of innovative financial services, and finally change in government approach, and the transition to FinTech will be achieved\",\n",

       " \"The merger of technological applications with finance has taken its place in the literature as Financial Technology (Fintech) starting from the 1990s, although it has become more frequent especially after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Fintech, as the name suggests, is the fusion of finance and technology. It is known that technology has always affected the finance industry and changed the way it works. For example, the introduction of Autometed Teller Machine (ATM), money transfer systems and the increase in productivity emerged with these developments in the financial sector have been inevitable. The question is, what makes the current Fintech revolution different from other periods? First, the testing and introduction of new technologies into financial markets has never been so rapid before. Another important point is that the impact of today's development is not only on the financial markets, but also on the economy as a whole, as new start-ups and large technology companies create competition outside the financial sector with the financial products they develop, creating an exogenous effect on the entire economy. Today's Fintech concept has transcended the financial market and has become the focus of entrepreneurs from different sectors. For this reason, the impact of Fintech on the economies and growth of countries is a topic that needs to be researched more than ever. With all this, Fintech promotes participation in financial markets around the world, enabling millions of people and businesses to participate in the global economy. Access to financial services is critical for global development as it facilitates investment in health, education and business. Concordantly, within the scope of this thesis, it is aimed to create a composite indicator representing Fintech development of countries by using the prominent determinants of it and to provide guidance to policy makers by revealing the policies recommended to be followed in order to come to the forefront in this field on a country-specific basis. In this direction, firstly, a composite indicator was created by detecting the determinants of Fintech and then, using the indicator scores, policy recommendations were made for each country with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL).

       " \"The rapid development of digital finance technologies has brought unprecedented opportunities and challenges to the insurance industry. Taking 100 Chinese insurance enterprises as research samples, this paper constructs a high-quality development index system for insurance enterprises through the entropy-weighted TOPSIS method and then explores the economic consequences of digital finance on insurance enterprises from the perspective of high-quality development. The study finds that digital finance significantly improves the level of high-quality development of insurance enterprises, empowers Chinese insurance enterprises, and passes the endogeneity control and robustness test. In terms of the mechanism of action, digital finance plays the functions of promoting corporate innovation, alleviating financing constraints, empowering corporate management, and enhancing labor efficiency, which helps insurance enterprises alleviate financing constraints, enhance the level of innovation, reduce the cost of management, and optimize the allocation of labor resources, thus positively affecting the high-quality development of insurance enterprises. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis finds that the enabling role of digital finance is not affected by the nature of enterprise property rights, insurance structure, and life cycle. This study empirically verifies the role of digital finance in boosting the insurance entity enterprises, which provides a reference for the sustainable development and digital transformation of China's insurance industry.\",\n",

To many others, however, the term is in fact attaching ethnicity to the virus. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the term’s real-world usage on Twitter. Using sentiment feature analysis and topic modeling, we reveal substantial differences between the use of the controversial terms such as “Chinese virus” and that of the non-controversial terms such as “COVID-19”. For example, tweets using controversial terms contain a higher percentage of anger as well as negative emotions. They also point to China more frequently. Our results suggest that while the term “Chinese virus” could be interpreted either as neutral or racist, its usage on social media leans strongly towards the latter.',\n",

       " 'Crowdfunding creates opportunities for entrepre- neurs. It allows startup companies to reach a large audience for fundraising and bring their creative ideas to life. In this work, we are concerned with crowdfunding project success prediction problem,i.e., to predict whether a project will successfully reach its funding goal by using its project profiles. This is important for startup companies to refine their project profiles and achieve their goals. Crowdfunding project success prediction is a typical classification problem but with a few critical challenges. On the one hand, with only coarse-grained project status as weak supervision, it is hard for a deep learning network to learn the relationship between project profiles and explain why it makes this prediction. On the other hand, on the project homepage, there are various modalities of description, including metadata, textual description, images, and videos. Among those, videos play an important role in the success of a crowdfunding project, however, were ignored in previous works, due to the difficulty in extracting useful semantic and authentic information from videos, especially for the crowdfunding project where information in different modalities are unaligned. To this end, we propose a novel framework called Deep Cross-Attention Network to learn and fuse information from introduction videos and textual descriptions of project profiles. More specifically, we develop a cross-attention block to align and represent mismatched textual description and untrimmed introduction videos and fuse the information from these two modalities, which effectively remedies the lack of supervised information caused by project status as weak supervision. More importantly, with our cross-attention mechanism, the model is able to interpret how it makes such predictions and show which keywords and keyframes it depends on. We conduct extensive experiments on two crowdfunding datasets (collected from Kickstarter and Indiegogo) and show that our method achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art baselines.',\n",

Donations on crowdfunding platforms have received attention; however, repeated donations, especially during COVID-19, need to be studied. This study aims to understand the role of reward-based gamification as a tool for understanding repeated donation behaviour on crowdfunding platforms during COVID-19. The study uses the self-determination theory to propose the conceptual framework and uses cross sectional data from 514 donors using survey based instruments. This study aims to understand the role of social relatedness with donors’ intrinsic motivation to make repeated donations. Similarly, it tries to establish the role of social relatedness and engagement with repeated donation behaviour. The study uses reward-based gamification as moderating variables, and the model controls the experience of donating on crowdfunding platforms. The results confirm the relationship between social relatedness impacting a donor’s intrinsic motivation and engagement in crowdfunding platform activities leading to repeated donation behaviour. The study further establishes that reward-based gamification moderates the relationship between intrinsic motivation and repeated donation behaviour. The results reveal that the experience of donating impacts the users' repeated donations. The study presents new insights on the role of gamification in inducing repeated donations on crowdfunding platforms during COVID-19.\",\n",

First impressions (FIs) of an OMCC, including perceived empathy, credibility, justice, impact, and attractiveness, could affect viewers’ donation decisions. Images play a crucial role in manifesting FIs, and it is beneficial for fundraisers to understand how viewers may judge their selected images for OMCCs beforehand. This work proposes a data-driven approach to assessing whether an OMCC image conveys appropriate FIs. We first crowdsource viewers’ perception of OMCC images. Statistical analysis confirms that agreement on all five dimensions of FIs exists, and these FIs positively correlate with donation intention. We compute image content, color, texture, and composition features, then analyze the correlation between these visual features and FIs. We further predict FIs based on these features, and the best model achieves an overall F1-score of 0.727. Finally, we discuss how our insights could benefit fundraisers and possible ethical concerns.',\n",
       " \"The use of emotions in the communication content of entrepreneurial projects on crowdfunding platforms has been associated with fundraising performance. Other studies have suggested that the extensive use of emotions can have a detrimental effect on their perception as a trustworthy information source. Bringing these two streams of literature together, we theorize that the level of emotional brightness—that is, the tone of a project's content on the continuum from negative to positive emotions—generates both perceptions of empathy and inauthenticity. The interplay between these perceptions produces an inverted U-shaped relationship between the level of emotional brightness of a crowdfunding project and the project's performance. Drawing on a dataset of 2500 Kickstarter projects, we find support for this hypothesis. We also find that the goal amount moderates this relationship because funders pay more attention to projects with higher goal amounts due to their salience; the higher the goal amount is, the steeper the inverted U-shape is. Finally, considering both written text (the description of the project) and images (the photo on the project's landing page), we find that the moderating effect of the project's goal amount is stronger for emotions conveyed through images than those conveyed through text. Our paper contributes to deepening the understanding of the relationship between emotions and crowdfunding performance by revealing the benefits and limitations of using emotions in crowdfunding projects. Attempts to manipulate an audience's perception by arousing its emotions are a double-edged sword that entrepreneurs should use cautiously.\",\n",
       " 'Crowdfunding creates opportunities for creative people to raise funds so their ideas can be brought to life. However, the failure of fundraising leads to certain losses for project starters. Crowdfunding success prediction allows them to learn about the probability of fundraising success as early as possible, which can reduce their losses or lead them to modify project content for increasing the probability. Crowdfunding success prediction is a challenging classification task because there is diverse descriptive data but relative little supervisory information. There has been a lot of work done based on post-launch factors, but pre-launch prediction is more valuable for project creators and crowdfunding platforms. Although some efforts on pre-launch prediction were also made, most of them only analyze one or more of metadata, text and image, and the multimodal study about text and video is lacked. Considering this, we propose a multimodal dynamic graph convolutional network for crowdfunding success prediction based on text and video data. Specifically, sentences and frames are viewed as nodes, and edges are constructed based on location relationships and cosine similarity, which reconstructs the text and video into a multimodal graph and allows multimodal features to interact in the form of a graph. Besides, dynamic graph convolution is utilized to fuse the features of nodes, where dynamic means the structure of graph changes during graph convolution. Besides, we make two multimodal crowdfunding datasets containing metadata, text, image, video and project status, and they are utilized to validate the effectiveness of crowdfunding prediction models. Experiments conducted on them show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, and interaction and fusion in the form of a graph can effectively integrate features from multiple modalities.',\n",
       " 'Prior research offers a minimal amount of direct evidence on the effect of gamification features such as top-donor leaderboards on medical crowdfunding, particularly regarding donor engagement, contributions per donor, and total campaign funds. The study analyzes data from 3,415 distinct medical campaigns, leveraging an unannounced change on GoFundMe. The findings reveal a complex scenario that defies simple expectations. The leaderboard is expected to increase donor engagement, but it appears to discourage larger contributions per donor, a phenomenon termed “crowding out.” Despite these mixed outcomes, there is a positive correlation between the leaderboard’s presence and the funds raised. These findings highlight the potential of leaderboards to increase engagement and total funds raised in medical crowdfunding campaigns. However, the crowding-out effect raises concerns about the Pareto efficiency of this motivation system. This research contributes insights to both practitioners and theorists, shedding light on the complex interplay between gamification features and crowdfunding outcomes in the medical context.',\n",

By confirming that the documents are legitimate for voting and funding, authorized individuals can donate money to the various initiatives they support. Smart contracts will forward monies gathered to the appropriate fundraisers if the majority of donors approve. When their limit is reached, they will be able to access their money using a smart contract. The blockchain keeps track of every transaction. The platform will be safer and more transparent with the use of these smart contracts. Better than the conventional apps, this offers consumers access to a fully functional and safe crowdfunding online application platform.',\n",

       " 'The online solicitation of public donations has become an important financing option for health care expenses, intensified by increasing costs and deficits of universal public systems . With growing internet access and success of the largest social crowdfunding platform, GoFundMe, online appeals for medical causes have grown significantly over the last decade in low-to high-income countries. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively describe the use of GoFundMe as a crowdfunding platform for global health initiatives given its supremacy in the social crowdfunding market. Three different cohorts (n=100 each) of online solicitation were examined as a cross-section comparing global health appeals to those for personal health care and animal activism. Variables included the purpose for crowdfunding, the characteristics of beneficiaries and campaigns, and the factors associated with funding success. Our cross-sectional review found that global health campaigns were focused on voluntourism opportunities compared to more specific, individualized appeals for those in need. Global health campaigns appeared to be the least ambitious and generally the least successful of those reviewed. Grouping the most and least successful campaigns between the different cohorts, global health appears to be more successful when targeting a larger population to donate smaller amounts of money and relying on sharing via social media. We suggest that compared to online solicitation for personal health and animal activism objectives, crowdfunding on GoFundMe has unrealized potential as a tool for global health initiatives. More work should be conducted using different crowdfunding platforms and a more longitudinal review in order to expand on these findings and their implications on health care provision in the countries examined. Furthermore, future inquiry is needed to understand the social and ethical implications of online solicitation for global health endeavors in order to inform policy and promote discussion around equity and accessibility.',\n",

Previous research has focused on exploring the relationship between the project's basic features and fundraising's success. And there is a lack of comparative research among cross-country crowdfunding platforms. This study uses the technologies of feature engineering, natural language processing, and image recognition to extract important features that affect the success of fundraising from the text and images. And find the combination of important features and algorithms that can optimally predict project results, the number of backers, and the fundraising amount. In addition, this study compares crowdfunding platforms in the US and Taiwan, Kickstarter and ZecZec, whether there are differences in the combination of important features. The data source is 40,486 projects on Kickstarter and 3,342 projects on ZecZec obtained through web crawling. This study extracts features through feature engineering, and uses Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree machine learning algorithms to understand the prediction performance of combining the three types of features. And calculate the feature importance to identify important features that affect the success of crowdfunding and analyze the differences of important features on different platforms.\",\n",

In particular, social marketing techniques that alter the target audience’s behaviors for the public good can substantially improve vaccine uptake if adopted as a communication strategy in immunization programs to counter public hesitancy. This study presents evidence from the Korean government’s current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination campaign, which successfully applied a social marketing approach. By the end of August 2022, South Korea had achieved high vaccine coverage, with 94.8% of the population (12+) receiving a second dose, 71.3% a third dose, and a fourth dose drive currently underway. There are five crucial factors to consider when preparing official communication for an immunization program:(i) a high degree of proactiveness,(ii) credibility,(iii) fighting misinformation,(iv) emphasizing social norms and prosocial behavior, and (v) coherence. Although using social marketing strategies may not be successful in all circumstances, the lessons learned and current implementation in Korea suggest their efficacy in fostering vaccine acceptance. This study offers valuable insights for government agencies and global public health practitioners to develop effective targeted campaign strategies that enhance the target population’s vaccination intention.',\n",

In this work, motivated by recent natural language processing techniques to systematically extract and quantify opinions from text messages, we present a differential framework for bivariate opinion formation dynamics that is coupled with a compartmental model for fake news dissemination. Thanks to a mean-field analysis we demonstrate that the resulting Fokker-Planck system permits to reproduce bimodal distributions of opinions as observed in polarization dynamics. The model is then applied to sentiment analysis data from social media platforms in Italy, in order to analyze the evolution of opinions about Covid-19 vaccination. We show through numerical simulations that the model is capable to describe correctly the formation of the bimodal opinion structure observed in the vaccine-hesitant dataset, which is witness of the known polarization effects that happen within closed online communities.',\n",

       " 'Being exposed to and believing in misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines is a challenge for vaccine acceptance. Yet, how countervailing factors such as news literacy could complicate “the information exposure—belief in vaccine misinformation—vaccination” path needs to be unpacked to understand the communication of scientific information about COVID-19. This study examines (1) the mediating role of belief in vaccine misinformation between COVID-19 information exposure and vaccination behavior and (2) the moderating role of news literacy behaviors. We examine these relationships by collecting data in two distinct societies: the United States and South Korea. We conducted online surveys in June and September 2021 respectively for each country (N= 1336 [the U.S.];N= 550 [South Korea]). Our results showed a significant moderated mediation model, in which the association between digital media reliance and COVID-19 vaccination was mediated through vaccine misperceptions, and the relationship between digital media reliance and misinformed belief was further moderated by news literacy behavior. Unexpectedly, we found that individuals with stronger news literacy behavior were more susceptible to misinformation belief. This study contributes to the extant literature on the communication of COVID-19 science through probing into the mediating role of belief in vaccine-related misinformation and the moderating role of news literacy behavior in relation to COVID-19 information exposure and vaccination behaviors. It also reflects the concept of news literacy behavior and discusses how it could be further refined to exert its positive impact in correcting misinformation beliefs.',\n",

       " 'Fake news spreads at an unprecedented speed, reaches global audiences and poses huge risks to users and communities. Most existing fake news detection algorithms focus on building supervised training models on a large amount of manually labeled data, which is expensive to acquire or often unavailable. In this work, we propose a novel label noise-resistant mean teaching approach (LNMT) for weakly supervised fake news detection. LNMT leverages unlabeled news and feedback comments of users to enlarge the amount of training data and facilitates model training by generating refined labels as weak supervision. Specifically, LNMT automatically assigns initial weak labels to unlabeled samples based on semantic correlation and emotional association between news content and the comments. Moreover, in order to suppress the noises in weak labels, LNMT establishes a mean teacher framework equipped with label propagation and label reliability estimation. The framework measures a weak label similarity matrix between the teacher and student networks, and propagates different valuable weak label information to refine the weak labels. Meanwhile, it exploits the consistency between the output class likelihood vectors of the two networks to evaluate the reliability of the weak labels and incorporates the reliability into model optimization to alleviate the negative effect of noisy weak labels. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of LNMT.',\n",

However, the uptake of the vaccines is largely voluntary and depends on the intentions of the public. From a social marketing perspective, this study takes the case of Italy to identify and test factors that are likely to increase COVID-19-vaccine intention. A sample of 3893 respondents was collected throughout Italy and a model empirically tested by structural equation modeling. The findings suggest that a social marketing campaign for undertaking COVID-19 vaccines should educate the public, going beyond just safety and efficacy, and create positive social norms by combatting misinformation on various platforms, including social media. Furthermore, it was found that economic hardship from COVID-19 does not automatically translate to vaccination intention and that social marketing campaigns should particularly target economically vulnerable and important segments. Also, instilling a craving for travel could potentially stimulate citizens to undertake COVID-19 inoculation. Finally, contributions and implications for social marketing COVID-19 vaccines in Italy and elsewhere are addressed.',\n",

For instance, according to the Guardian, most COVID-19 misinformation comes from users on social media. Without fact-checking social media news, misinformation can lead to health threats. In this paper, we focus on the novel problem of bridging the gap between online and offline data by monitoring their common and distinct topics generated over time. We employ Twitter (online) and local news (offline) data for a time span of two years. Using online matrix factorization, we analyze and study online and offline COVID-19-related data differences and commonalities.

Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language and multimodal tasks, this survey provides a detailed overview of recent advancements in video understanding that harness the power of LLMs (Vid-LLMs). The emergent capabilities of Vid-LLMs are surprisingly advanced, particularly their ability for open-ended multi-granularity (general, temporal, and spatiotemporal) reasoning combined with commonsense knowledge, suggesting a promising path for future video understanding. We examine the unique characteristics and capabilities of Vid-LLMs, categorizing the approaches into three main types: Video Analyzer x LLM, Video Embedder x LLM, and (Analyzer + Embedder) x LLM. Furthermore, we identify five sub-types based on the functions of LLMs in Vid-LLMs: LLM as Summarizer, LLM as Manager, LLM as Text Decoder, LLM as Regressor, and LLM as Hidden Layer. Furthermore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for Vid-LLMs. Additionally, it explores the expansive applications of Vid-LLMs across various domains, highlighting their remarkable scalability and versatility in real-world video understanding challenges.

       " \"This study compared the classification performance of Gemini Pro and GPT-4V in educational settings. Employing visual question answering (VQA) techniques, the study examined both models' abilities to read text-based rubrics and then automatically score student-drawn models in science education. We employed both quantitative and qualitative analyses using a dataset derived from student-drawn scientific models and employing NERIF (Notation-Enhanced Rubrics for Image Feedback) prompting methods. The findings reveal that GPT-4V significantly outperforms Gemini Pro in terms of scoring accuracy and Quadratic Weighted Kappa. The qualitative analysis reveals that the differences may be due to the models' ability to process fine-grained texts in images and overall image classification performance. Even adapting the NERIF approach by further de-sizing the input images, Gemini Pro seems not able to perform as well as GPT-4V. The findings suggest GPT-4V's superior capability in handling complex multimodal educational tasks.

Specifically, we explore the potential of its generated rich textual descriptions across various categories to enhance recognition performance without any training. Additionally, we evaluate its visual proficiency in directly recognizing diverse visual content. To achieve this, we conduct an extensive series of experiments, systematically quantifying the performance of GPT-4 across three modalities: images, videos, and point clouds. This comprehensive evaluation encompasses a total of 16 widely recognized benchmark datasets, providing top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics. Our study reveals that leveraging GPT-4's advanced linguistic knowledge to generate rich descriptions markedly improves zero-shot recognition. In terms of visual proficiency, GPT-4V's average performance across 16 datasets sits roughly between the capabilities of OpenAI-CLIP's ViT-L and EVA-CLIP's ViT-E.

However, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encounter two issues in such scenarios: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception, and (2) a tendency to blend information across multiple images. We first extensively investigate the capability of LMMs to perceive fine-grained visual details when dealing with multiple input images. The research focuses on two aspects: first, image-to-image matching (to evaluate whether LMMs can effectively reason and pair relevant images), and second, multi-image-to-text matching (to assess whether LMMs can accurately capture and summarize detailed image information). We conduct evaluations on a range of both open-source and closed-source large models, including GPT-4V, Gemini, OpenFlamingo, and MMICL. To enhance model performance, we further develop a Contrastive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT) prompting approach based on multi-input multimodal models. This method requires LMMs to compare the similarities and differences among multiple image inputs, and then guide the models to answer detailed questions about multi-image inputs based on the identified similarities and differences. Our experimental results showcase CoCoT's proficiency in enhancing the multi-image comprehension capabilities of large multimodal models.\",\n",

Second, an evolutionary information extractor is designed to summarize the semantic regularities between the paired memes for prompting. Finally, a contextual relevance amplifier enhances the in-context hatefulness information to boost the search for evolutionary processes.

       " \"Emojis have become an integral part of digital communication, enriching text by conveying emotions, tone, and intent. Existing emoji recommendation methods are primarily evaluated based on their ability to match the exact emoji a user chooses in the original text. However, they ignore the essence of users' behavior on social media in that each text can correspond to multiple reasonable emojis. To better assess a model's ability to align with such real-world emoji usage, we propose a new semantics preserving evaluation framework for emoji recommendation, which measures a model's ability to recommend emojis that maintain the semantic consistency with the user's text. To evaluate how well a model preserves semantics, we assess whether the predicted affective state, demographic profile, and attitudinal stance of the user remain unchanged. If these attributes are preserved, we consider the recommended emojis to have maintained the original semantics. The advanced abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and generating nuanced, contextually relevant output make them well-suited for handling the complexities of semantics preserving emoji recommendation. To this end, we construct a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess the performance of six proprietary and open-source LLMs using different prompting techniques on our task. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o outperforms other LLMs, achieving a semantics preservation score of 79.23%. Additionally, we conduct case studies to analyze model biases in downstream classification tasks and evaluate the diversity of the recommended emojis.\",\n",

However, the application potential of LVLMs in the insurance domain-characterized by rich application scenarios and abundant multimodal data-has not been effectively explored. There is no systematic review of multimodal tasks in the insurance domain, nor a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance. This gap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance domain. In this paper, we systematically review and distill multimodal tasks for four representative types of insurance: auto insurance, property insurance, health insurance, and agricultural insurance. We propose INS-MMBench, the first comprehensive LVLMs benchmark tailored for the insurance domain. INS-MMBench comprises a total of 2.2K thoroughly designed multiple-choice questions, covering 12 meta-tasks and 22 fundamental tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple representative LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o and open-source models like BLIP-2. This evaluation not only validates the effectiveness of our benchmark but also provides an in-depth performance analysis of current LVLMs on various multimodal tasks in the insurance domain. We hope that INS-MMBench will facilitate the further application of LVLMs in the insurance domain and inspire interdisciplinary development.

       " 'With the advent and widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. To achieve this objective, it requires us to proactively discover the vulnerability of MLLMs by exploring the attack methods. Thus, structure-based jailbreak attacks, where harmful semantic content is embedded within images, have been proposed to mislead the models. However, previous structure-based jailbreak methods mainly focus on transforming the format of malicious queries, such as converting harmful content into images through typography, which lacks sufficient jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability. To address these limitations, we first introduce the concept of \"Role-play\" into MLLM jailbreak attacks and propose a novel and effective method called Visual Role-play (VRP). Specifically, VRP leverages Large Language Models to generate detailed descriptions of high-risk characters and create corresponding images based on the descriptions. When paired with benign role-play instruction texts, these high-risk character images effectively mislead MLLMs into generating malicious responses by enacting characters with negative attributes. We further extend our VRP method into a universal setup to demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that VRP outperforms the strongest baseline, Query relevant and FigStep, by an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) margin of 14.3% across all models.',\n",

Understanding social multimedia content remains a challenging problem for contemporary machine learning frameworks. In this talk, we evaluate GPT-4V(ision)'s capabilities for social multimedia analysis. We select five representative tasks, including sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, fake news identification, demographic inference, and political ideology detection, to evaluate GPT-4V. Our investigation begins with a preliminary quantitative analysis for each task using existing benchmark datasets, followed by a careful review of the results and a selection of qualitative samples that illustrate GPT-4V's potential in understanding multimodal social media content. GPT-4V demonstrates remarkable efficacy in these tasks, showcasing strengths such as joint understanding of image-text pairs, contextual and cultural awareness, and extensive commonsense knowledge. In addition to the known hallucination problem, notable challenges remain as GPT-4V struggles with tasks involving multilingual social multimedia comprehension and has difficulties in generalizing to the latest trends in social media.

Social media posts provide an opportunity to uncover hidden risks related to group consciousness or underlying issues behind societal phenomena through public attention and discourse. However, these risks are diverse and multifaceted, with some being difficult to define in advance, which makes it challenging to analyze them using pre-set algorithms. Previous solutions often utilized predefined algorithm for known risk categories, which cannot handle diverse social risks. Encouragingly, the recent development of general-purpose language models has provided powerful tools for analyzing complex and unknown types of risks. This paper is based on the use of social media data to perform clustering analysis on complex multimodal event data. Then we employ large language models to conduct causal inference on the resulting clusters of events to discover potential social risks. Extensive experiments on social media data have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its capability to analyze intricate risk factors that were previously difficult to address.',\n",

However, such a paradigm faces the challenge of the potential \"determining hallucinations\" in decision generation due to insufficient visual information and the limitation of low-level perception tools that fail to provide abstract summaries necessary for comprehensive reasoning. We argue that converging visual context acquisition and logical reasoning is pivotal for tackling visual reasoning tasks. This paper delves into the realm of multimodal CoT to solve intricate visual reasoning tasks with multimodal large language models(MLLMs) and their cognitive capability. To this end, we propose an innovative multimodal CoT framework, termed Cantor, characterized by a perception-decision architecture. Cantor first acts as a decision generator and integrates visual inputs to analyze the image and problem, ensuring a closer alignment with the actual context. Furthermore, Cantor leverages the advanced cognitive functions of MLLMs to perform as multifaceted experts for deriving higher-level information, enhancing the CoT generation process.

However, incorporating multimodal rationales in CoT has yet to be thoroughly investigated. We propose the Image-of-Thought (IoT) prompting method, which helps MLLMs to extract visual rationales step-by-step. Specifically, IoT prompting can automatically design critical visual information extraction operations based on the input images and questions. Each step of visual information refinement identifies specific visual rationales that support answers to complex visual reasoning questions. Beyond the textual CoT, IoT simultaneously utilizes visual and textual rationales to help MLLMs understand complex multimodal information.

       " 'There have been recent efforts to extend the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by finding visual clues in the input scene, advancing the visual reasoning ability of MLLMs. However, current approaches are specially designed for the tasks where clue finding plays a major role in the whole reasoning process, leading to the difficulty in handling complex visual scenes where clue finding does not actually simplify the whole reasoning task. To deal with this challenge, we propose a new visual reasoning paradigm enabling MLLMs to autonomously modify the input scene to new ones based on its reasoning status, such that CoT is reformulated as conducting simple closed-loop decision-making and reasoning steps under a sequence of imagined visual scenes, leading to natural and general CoT construction. To implement this paradigm, we introduce a novel plug-and-play imagination space, where MLLMs conduct visual modifications through operations like focus, ignore, and transform based on their native reasoning ability without specific training. We validate our approach through a benchmark spanning dense counting, simple jigsaw puzzle solving, and object placement, challenging the reasoning ability beyond clue finding.

In this work, we propose TextCoT, a novel Chain-of-Thought framework for text-rich image understanding. TextCoT utilizes the captioning ability of LMMs to grasp the global context of the image and the grounding capability to examine local textual regions. This allows for the extraction of both global and local visual information, facilitating more accurate question-answering. Technically, TextCoT consists of three stages, including image overview, coarse localization, and fine-grained observation. The image overview stage provides a comprehensive understanding of the global scene information, and the coarse localization stage approximates the image area containing the answer based on the question asked. Then, integrating the obtained global image descriptions, the final stage further examines specific regions to provide accurate answers.

Recent methods aim to address these limitations by relying on the semantics of the textual description, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to break them down into subsets of questions and answers.

In response to these issues, we present Caption Expansion with Contradictions and Entailments (CECE), a principled approach that leverages Natural Language Inference (NLI) to generate entailments and contradictions from a given premise. CECE produces lexically diverse sentences while maintaining their core meaning. Through extensive experiments, we show that CECE enhances interpretability and reduces overreliance on biased or superficial features.

Guided by the strong Black woman schema and Double ABC-X Model as theoretical frameworks, this study examined the inequities of the additional stressors and responsibilities of working from home, heightened parent engagement, financial insecurity, and mental stress. During the timeframe of August 2020 and October 2021, Black mothers self-reported stressors and described their financial, job and housing insecurities to the US Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (HPS), publicly accessible data set. Data was collected biweekly for real time tracking. A series of chi-square goodness of fit tests and descriptive characteristics including frequency analysis were conducted to answer eight research questions. Three overarching key questions directed the statistical analyses: 1) How do Black mothers report stressors? 2) How do Black mothers describe their financial security and insecurity? 3) How did Black mothers navigate working from home and online education? Key findings indicated significant disproportionate levels of distress Black mothers compared to non-Black mothers during the pandemic. Results exposed the financial fragility, food insufficiency, housing insecurity and health inequities of this subset group. Implications for the field expanding current focus of societal effects of the pandemic to include examining the crisis Black professional mothers are struggling to manage as a result of the pandemic.',\n",

       " 'Learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), in which nodes are associated with one or more texts, has been the subject of much recent work. However, most approaches tend to make strong assumptions about the downstream task of interest, are reliant on hand-labeled data, or fail to equally balance the importance of both text and graph representations. In this work, we propose Contrastive Graph-Text pretraining (ConGraT), a general, self-supervised approach for jointly learning separate representations of texts and nodes in a TAG. Our method trains a language model (LM) and a graph neural network (GNN) to align their representations in a common latent space using a batch-wise contrastive learning objective inspired by CLIP. We further propose an extension to the CLIP objective that leverages graph structure to incorporate information about inter-node similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConGraT outperforms baselines on various downstream tasks, including node and text category classification, link prediction, and language modeling. Finally, we present an application of our method to community detection in social graphs, which enables finding more textually grounded communities, rather than purely graph-based ones.

In contrast to traditional comment-only methods, our approach to labelling a comment as hate speech involves a holistic analysis of text and images grounded in the discussion context. This is done by leveraging graph transformers to capture the contextual relationships in the discussion surrounding a comment and grounding the interwoven fusion layers that combine text and image embeddings instead of processing modalities separately. To evaluate our work, we present a new dataset, HatefulDiscussions, comprising complete multi-modal discussions from multiple online communities on Reddit.

       " 'The recent wave of elections won by right-wing worldwide brings up increased discussions biased by political polarization, including in social media. Social media data enables the investigation of the contexts where political polarization occurs, enabling to derive insights into how it affects human behavior. Related work has shown how computing techniques can be leveraged to understand political polarization in restricted scenarios, but the complexity of this behavior can be better understood when considered from different viewpoints. This article describes a multi-dimensional analysis framework to study the behavior of groups on Twitter in politically polarized scenarios. It can be applied to various themes where groups display stances that can be politically biased, and it aggregates a wide range of computational techniques in an innovative way to provide rich insights. The framework includes guidelines and techniques to: (a) collect data on Twitter to represent the groups; (b) automatically infer the political leaning of users; (c) derive topological properties of the groups’ social network and analyze political influence; (d) identify topics representing concerns at coarse and fine-grained granularity levels using a hybrid topic modeling approach; (e) identify psychological aspects based on linguistic cues, and (f) analyze the sources of information disseminated by the groups. Applying the framework in two case studies related to COVID-19 revealed patterns of behavior common to ideologies. We confirmed that the stances were politically motivated and that both groups, left/right, were subject to the echo chamber effect. Comparatively, the social structure of the right-oriented groups is more connected, and they rely on politicians and social media for information spreading. Left-oriented groups are less connected and more prone to facts. The psychological aspects reveal that both groups are emotionally distressed in arguing about being right, given their beliefs.',\n",

However, prior studies on measuring the discrepancies among media outlets and further dissecting the origins of thematic differences suffer from small sample sizes and limited scope and granularity. In this study, we use a large dataset of 1.8 million news headlines from major U.S. media outlets spanning from 2014 to 2022 to thoroughly track and dissect the fine-grained thematic discrepancy in U.S. news media. We employ multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to quantify the fine-grained thematic discrepancy related to four prominent topics - domestic politics, economic issues, social issues, and foreign affairs in order to derive a more holistic analysis. Additionally, we compare the most frequent-grams in media headlines to provide further qualitative insights into our analysis. Our findings indicate that on domestic politics and social issues, the discrepancy can be attributed to a certain degree of media bias. Meanwhile, the discrepancy in reporting foreign affairs is largely attributed to the diversity in individual journalistic styles. Finally, U.S. media outlets show consistency and high similarity in their coverage of economic issues.',\n",

Recent advancements have leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to integrate these data, they often fall short in capturing the complex high-order relations within multimodal data, but readily hypergraph structures are not always available. To this end, we introduce the HMRec framework, a novel approach in Heterogeneous Hypergraph Structure Learning tailored for MRS. Specifically, we formulate the construction of a heterogeneous hypergraph as determining item associations across modalities, and introduce an adaptive hypergraph convolution mechanism for differentially weighting multimodal hyperedges. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced multimedia recommendation module, which introduces a contrastive fusion mechanism to effectively integrate graph-view, hypergraph-view, and ID-specific embeddings.

       " 'Developing machine learning models to characterize political polarization on online social media presents significant challenges. These challenges mainly stem from various factors such as the lack of annotated data, presence of noise in social media datasets, and the sheer volume of data. The common research practice typically examines the biased structure of online user communities for a given topic or qualitatively measuring the impacts of polarized topics on social media. However, there is limited work focusing on analyzing polarization at the ground-level, specifically in the social media posts themselves. Such existing analysis heavily relies on annotated data, which often requires laborious human labeling, offers labels only to specific problems, and lacks the ability to determine the near-future bias state of a social media conversations. Understanding the degree of political orientation conveyed in social media posts is crucial for quantifying the bias of online user communities and investigating the spread of polarized content. In this work, we first introduce two heuristic methods that leverage on news media bias and post content to label social media posts. Next, we compare the efficacy and quality of heuristically labeled dataset with a randomly sampled human-annotated dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate that current machine learning models can exhibit improved performance in predicting political orientation of social media posts, employing both traditional supervised learning and few-shot learning setups. We conduct experiments using the proposed heuristic methods and machine learning approaches to predict the political orientation of posts collected from two social media forums with diverse political ideologies: Gab and Twitter.',\n",
       " 'Social media platforms provide a rich environment for analyzing user behavior. Recently, deep learning-based methods have been a mainstream approach for social media analysis models involving complex patterns. However, these methods are susceptible to biases in the training data, such as participation inequality. Basically, a mere 1% of users generate the majority of the content on social networking sites, while the remaining users, though engaged to varying degrees, tend to be less active in content creation and largely silent. These silent users consume and listen to information that is propagated on the platform. However, their voice, attitude, and interests are not reflected in the online content, making the decision of the current methods predisposed towards the opinion of the active users. So models can mistake the loudest users for the majority. To make the silent majority heard is to reveal the true landscape of the platform.',\n",
       " 'The shift from traditional print media to online platforms has revolutionized the way people consume and engage with current events. To enhance user involvement, these platforms typically employ personalization algorithms like recommendation systems, that learn about users’ preferences from their past interactions and suggest relevant content. Nevertheless, the use of such algorithms may result in biased engagement patterns caused by data that was influenced by the recommendation system itself, leading to concerns about\" filter bubbles\" and\" echo chambers\". Such entities cause users to be over-exposed to information that conforms with their pre-existing beliefs while limiting exposure to opposing viewpoints. As a result, these types of news consumption habits can bias users, leading to negative consequences such as the hyper-partisanship, online polarization, and the spread of misinformation. In this dissertation we aim to better understand factors that affect short-term and long-term news engagement behavior on social media. To achieve this, we conduct simulation studies to understand which aspects of recommendation systems contribute to filter bubble formation. We propose attention-based neural networks to mitigate these effects in content-based recommenders. In addition, long-term news engagement behavior is examined by analyzing observational data collected from Twitter over a decade. Our analysis focuses on a specific type of engagement behavior where users exhibit distrust towards the news media they engage with and examine its impact on engagement diversity. Finally, we propose forecasting methods to predict future news engagement behavior of users which reveal factors that shape long-term news consumption habits on social media.',\n",

In violent settings, narratives tend to retrench into static accounts that increase prejudice and motivate greater acts of violence. Alternatively, dynamic narratives offer complex judgement, plot, character, and value assessments of the world thus encouraging more openness to others and peace. I propose a novel intervention for the generation of dynamic narratives. I use the practice ofshinrin yokuor guided forest walks in a seminar about Palestine and Israel, to invite liminality, the experience of communal spaces where traditional markers of power and social obligations are stripped.

While prior research has independently explored framing within news media and by social media users, there remains a notable gap in our comprehension of the disparities in framing political issues between these two distinct groups. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive investigation, focusing on the nuanced distinctions both qualitatively and quantitatively in the framing of social media and traditional media outlets concerning a series of American Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action, student loans, and abortion rights. Our findings reveal that, while some overlap in framing exists between social media and traditional media outlets, substantial differences emerge both across various topics and within specific framing categories. Compared to traditional news media, social media platforms tend to present more polarized stances across all framing categories. Further, we observe significant polarization in the news media’s treatment (i.e., Left vs. Right leaning media) of affirmative action and abortion rights, whereas the topic of student loans tends to exhibit a greater degree of consensus.

Furthermore, most existing multibranch architectures lose the interconnections between the branches during the feature learning stage. To address these issues, this article proposes a 2-D/3-D two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) with a location-aware adaptive normalization (LOAN) layer.

The study used weight assignment and overlay analysis to evaluate wildfire risk factors, including human, topographic, and climatic factors, using data from Landsat and WorldClim from 1991 to 2021. The wildfire risk model was validated using MODIS historical fire data from the Global Forest Watch database and Confusion Matrix, with the burned area extent identified using differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). The results show that despite 53% of the most burned area, only 12% was burned, with the high-risk zone accounting for only 11%, indicating a higher likelihood of wildfires spreading and intensifying.

Despite advancements in data collection and data analysis, challenges persist as ignitions depend on numerous interconnected factors at a fine spatial resolution. Predicting wildfire ignitions from data is an imbalanced classification problem, given the vast number of non-ignition data compared to ignition data. To address this issue, this study proposes an ensemble-based model for binary classification of wildfire ignitions. The data are collected for a 24,867\\xa0km2area in northern California from January 2014 to May 2022 and includes 76 predictors covering topographic, land cover, anthropogenic, and climatic data. Different base classifiers are evaluated and the random forest is found the most performant, yielding a recall of 0.67 and a specificity of 0.87. Feature importance analysis shows that the Topographic Wetness Index is the most important climatic predictor, while population density and land cover development are also highly rated. Comparison of yearly average of computed daily probabilities with ignition data shows that the model accurately captures the spatial pattern of ignitions, which can reveal high-risk areas. The model is then used to assess how climatic and anthropogenic factors impact wildfire ignition frequency. The projected scenarios show that the number and spread of ignitions would significantly increase with an increase in population in sparsely populated areas, while climatic factors have secondary effects in isolation but in combination may compound the risk. As current land development and climate change trends are expected to increase the frequency and severity of wildfires, data-based models can provide insights to inform policy and mitigate risk.',\n",
       " 'With a strong understanding of the target domain from natural language, we produce promising results in translating across large domain gaps and bringing skeletons back to life. In this work, we use text-guided latent diffusion models for zero-shot image-to-image translation (I2I) across large domain gaps (longI2I), where large amounts of new visual features and new geometry need to be generated to enter the target domain. Being able to perform translations across large domain gaps has a wide variety of real-world applications in criminology, astrology, environmental conservation, and paleontology. In this work, we introduce a new task Skull2Animal for translating between skulls and living animals. On this task, we find that unguided Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are not capable of translating across large domain gaps. Instead of these traditional I2I methods, we explore the use of guided diffusion and image editing models and provide a new benchmark model, Revive-2I, capable of performing zero-shot I2I via text-prompting latent diffusion models. We find that guidance is necessary for longI2I because, to bridge the large domain gap, prior knowledge about the target domain is needed. In addition, we find that prompting provides the best and most scalable information about the target domain as classifier-guided diffusion models require retraining for specific use cases and lack stronger constraints on the target domain because of the wide variety of images they are trained on.',\n",

However, machine learning use for forest fire ignition classification prediction within the platform and ones like it, is yet to be fully realized. We propose a novel framework that uses federated machine learning combined with Internet of Things technologies, for forest fire ignition classification prediction. The framework incorporates distributed IoT weather stations deployed in an area prone to forest fires. We find comparable prediction accuracy between a federated machine learning system and a central server machine learning system. Our federated system, trained on an imbalanced dataset comprising 5,008,365 non-ignition cases and 45,411 ignition instances, has shown encouraging outcomes. It attained an Accuracy of around 0.76 and a ROC-AUC of about 0.80. The performance is on par with other systems, indicating that our approach is effective in classifying forest fire ignitions with a spatial resolution markedly superior to that of centralized systems.',\n",

People found refuge on the internet and social media apps; however, there was a proliferation of instant messaging containing hoaxed, deliberate misleading information: fake news messaging (FNM). The aim of this study was to assess FNM through content analysis and to discriminate them in a proposed taxonomy structure. A sample of convenience of messages, memes, tweets or cartoons in several languages was selected from the most popular social media outlets, i.e. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc. More than 300 FNM were identified. Descriptive statistics were used for highlighting potential relationships between variables. Content analysis determined that FNM could be divided into Health- and non-health-related types. There are several sub-types considering, but not limited to, religious beliefs, politics, economy, nutrition, behaviors, prevention of the infection, the origin of the disease and conspiracy theories. The parallel FNM pandemic affected the response from an already debilitated public health system through the confusion created in the community and the erosion in the credibility of genuine media. Public health practitioners had to face people’s unpredictable behaviors, panic, tensions with the communities and, in some cases, a hostile climate toward frontline workers. Public health practitioners must adjust ongoing and future health promotion and education interventions including plans to neutralize fake news messages.',\n",

The task was to take a daily photo accompanied by a short description (text). The texts accompanying the photos were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software to analyze linguistic markers representing psychological processes related to the experience of the pandemic and the lockdown, identifying potential changes in psycholinguistic variables useful for understanding the psychological impact of such harsh and extended restricted living conditions on Italian students. LIWC categories related to negation, anger, cognitive mechanisms, tentative discourse, past, and future increased statistically significantly between the two time points, while word count, prepositions, communication, leisure, and home decreased statistically significantly. While male participants used more articles at both time points, females used more words related to anxiety, social processes, past, and present at T1 and more related to insight at T2. Participants who lived with their partner showed higher scores on negative emotions, affect, positive feelings, anger, optimism, and certainty. Participants from southern Italy tended to describe their experiences from a collective and social perspective rather than an individual perspective. By identifying, discussing, and comparing these phenomena with the broader literature, a spotlight is shed for the first time on the psycholinguistic analysis of students at the national level who faced the first COVID -19 lockdown in Italy.',\n",

Recently, scholars investigate consumers' pandemic-induced hoarding behavior, but studies that examined hoarding behavior concerning online commerce are insufficient. This study investigates how corona-related stress is led to the daily necessities hoarding model. Next, we explore whether consumers' trust in online commerce strengthens the hoarding mechanism. The results show that corona-related stress affects hoarding behavior through perceived scarcity, anticipated regret, and the urge to buy. In this process, the relationship between anticipated regret and the urge to buy is stronger in those who highly trust online commerce. This result suggests that it would be helpful for online commerce providers to build trust with customers during the pandemic.\",\n",

We find that people across various occupations, not just IT-related ones, show a strong interest in generative AI. The sentiment toward generative AI is generally positive, and remarkably, their sentiments are positively correlated with their exposure to AI. Among occupations, illustrators show exceptionally negative sentiment mainly due to concerns about the unethical usage of artworks in constructing AI.

Perceived experts occupied important network positions as central antivaccine users and bridges between the antivaccine and provaccine communities. Using propensity score matching, we found that perceived expertise brought an influence boost, as perceived experts were significantly more likely to receive likes and retweets in both the antivaccine and provaccine communities. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of the influence boost for perceived experts between the two communities.

This variability introduces uncertainties in forecasting, underscoring the necessity for enhanced forecasting models to support the large-scale integration of PV systems. Moreover, the presence of missing data during the model development process significantly impairs model performance.

This innovative approach adjusts the weights according to “sky status” and evaluates the performance of single-imputation models using criteria such as sky status, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), integrating them into a comprehensive weighted ensemble model. This model demonstrates improved RMSE values, ranging from 74.805 to 74.973, which corresponds to performance enhancements of 3.293–3.799% for KNN and 3.190–4.782% for MICE, thereby affirming its effectiveness in scenarios characterized by missing data.',\n",

To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks.

Systems are installed on rooftops, trackers, deployed with batteries, and in many other configurations. Virtual models of a system, called “digital twins,” are often constructed to predict future performance, quantify losses, schedule O&M, etc. However, due to increasing system diversity and complexity, constructing these digital twins from traditional physical models (such as PVSyst or the Sandia Array Performance Model) can be quite time consuming, prone to modeler error, and tend to require detailed, expensive site-specific metadata. Therefore, models that can learn a representation of the system from data (called “data-driven digital twins”) can be used alongside or in place of traditional, end-to-end physics-based models. In this work, we present a comparison of a empirical digital twin (using pvlib-python physics-based models) and a data-driven digital twin (using spatiotemporal graph neural networks) and quantify error metrics for the models. It is found that data-driven models best represent the average case of a PV system, whereas the empirical model better corresponds to oscillation due to weather variation.

The-characteristics of a PV module carry a huge amount of information. Traditional practice of-analysis involves curve fitting with predefined mathematical equations. The simplified equation however could create obstacles in understanding the data and the actual fault and degradation happening within the PV module could be overlooked. Data-driven model on the other hand will be able to extract information that is carried by the real data.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that KALM achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long document understanding tasks and datasets.

And four quadrants:“ideological stance”(high polarization, high alignment),“personal interests”(high polarization, low alignment),“thematic interest”(low polarization, low alignment), and “technical consensus”(low polarization, high alignment). We used this scheme to analyze an existing Open Linked Dataset with semantic web technologies (ontologies, RDF Shape expressions, and URI patterns), which records parliamentarians’ political parties and their voting on law proposals during 1990–2023. We found that most bills (70.14%) are in the technical consensus quadrant, and could have been quickly shepherded to approval. Wider adoption of this analysis to classify new bills may help to speed up their legislative processing, ultimately allowing Congress to serve citizens in a more timely manner.',\n",
       " 'Modeling social media users is the core of social governance in the digital society. Existing works have incorporated different digital traces to better learn the representations of social media users, including text information encoded by pre-trained language models and social network information encoded by graph models. However, limited by overloaded text information and hard-to-collect social network information, they cannot utilize global text information and cannot be generalized without social relationships. In this paper, we propose a Pre-training Architecture for Social Media User Modeling based on Text Graph (PASUM). We aggregate all microblogs to represent social media users based on the text graph model and learn the mapping from microblogs to user representation. We further design inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning tasks to inject general structural information into the mapping. In different scenarios, we can represent users based on text, even without social network information. Experimental results on various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework.',\n",
       " 'State-level policy decisions significantly influence various aspects of our daily lives, such as access to healthcare and education. Despite their importance, there is a limited understanding of how these policies and decisions are formulated within the legislative process. This dissertation aims to bridge that gap by utilizing data-driven methods and the latest advancements in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). By leveraging data-driven approaches, we can achieve a more objective and comprehensive understanding of policy formation. The incorporation of ML and NLP techniques aids in processing and interpreting large volumes of complex legislative texts, uncovering patterns and insights that might be overlooked through manual analysis. In this dissertation, we pose new analytical questions about the state legislative process and address them in three stages:First, we aim to understand the language of political agreement and disagreement in legislative texts. We introduce a novel NLP/ML task: predicting significant conflicts among legislators and sharp divisions in their votes on state bills, influenced by factors such as gender, rural-urban divides, and ideological differences. To achieve this, we construct a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, linking state bills with legislators’ information, geographical data about their districts, and details about donations and donors. We then develop a shared relational and textual deep learning model that captures the interactions between the bill’s text and the legislative context in which it is presented. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating this context enhances prediction accuracy compared to strong text-based models.Second, we analyze the impact of legislation on relevant stakeholders, such as teachers in education bills. We introduce this as a new prediction task within our framework to better understand the state legislative process. To address this task, we enhance our modeling and expand our dataset using various techniques, including crowd-sourcing, to generate labeled data. This approach also helps us decode legislators’ decision-making processes and voting patterns. Consequently, we refine our model to predict the winners and losers of bills, using this information to more accurately forecast the legislative body’s vote breakdown based on demographic and ideological criteria.Third, we enhance our analysis and modeling of state-level bills and policies using two techniques: We normalize the inconsistent, verbose, and complex language of state policies by leveraging Generative Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, we evaluate the policies within a broader network context by expanding the number of US states analyzed from 3 to 50 and incorporating new data sources, such as interest groups’ ratings of legislators and public information on legislators’ positions on various issues.By following these steps in this dissertation, we aim to better understand the legislative processes that shape state-level policies and their far-reaching effects on society.',\n",
       " 'Modeling the ideological perspectives of political actors is an essential task in computational political science with applications in many downstream tasks. Existing approaches are generally limited to textual data and voting records, while they neglect the rich social context and valuable expert knowledge for holistic evaluation. In this paper, we propose a representation learning framework of political actors that jointly leverages social context and expert knowledge. Specifically, we retrieve and extract factual statements about legislators to leverage social context information. We then construct a heterogeneous information network to incorporate social context and use relational graph neural networks to learn legislator representations. Finally, we train our model with three objectives to align representation learning with expert knowledge, model ideological stance consistency, and simulate the echo chamber phenomenon. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our learned representations successfully advance the state-of-the-art in three downstream tasks. Further analysis proves the correlation between learned legislator representations and various socio-political factors, as well as bearing out the necessity of social context and expert knowledge in modeling political actors.',\n",

Existing works have paved the way for knowledge extraction of this type of data by leveraging language models or graph neural networks or combination of them. However, these works suffer from issues like underutilization of relationships between nodes or words or unaffordable memory cost.

In NRUP, we construct a hierarchical text-attributed graph that incorporates both original nodes and word nodes. Meanwhile, we apply four self-supervised tasks for different level of constructed graph. We further design the pre-training framework to update the features of nodes during training epochs.

To solve these problems, we focus on a framework that simultaneously considers communities, users, and texts. And it can easily connect with a variety of downstream tasks related to social media. Specifically, we use a ternary heterogeneous graph to model online communities.

This undermines trust and limits the applicability of LLMs in different domains. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), on the other hand, provide a structured collection of interconnected facts represented as entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). In recent research, KGs have been leveraged to provide context that can fill gaps in an LLM understanding of certain topics offering a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs, enhancing their reliability and accuracy while benefiting from their wide applicability. Nonetheless, it is still a very active area of research with various unresolved open problems.

       " 'Framing studies how individuals and societies make sense of the world, by communicating or representing complex issues through schema of interpretation. The framing of information in the mass media influences our interpretation of facts and corresponding decisions, so detecting and analysing it is essential to understand biases in the information we consume. Despite that, framing is still mostly examined manually, on a case-by-case basis, while existing large-scale automatic analyses using NLP methods are not mature enough to solve this task. In this survey we show that despite the growing interest to framing in NLP its current approaches do not capture those aspects which allow to frame, rather than simply convey, the message. To this end, we bring together definitions of frames and framing adopted in different disciplines; examine cognitive, linguistic, and communicative aspects a frame contains beyond its topical content. We survey recent work on computational frame detection, and discuss how framing aspects and frame definitions are (or should) be reflected in NLP approaches.',\n",

We conduct an in-depth unsupervised linguistic analysis of each framing strategy, and uncover cross-movement similarities in associations between framing and linguistic features such as pronouns and deontic modal verbs.

       " 'Framing is an important mechanism in argumentation, as participants in a debate tend to emphasize those aspects or dimensions of the issue under debate that support their standpoint. The task of reframing an argument, that is changing the underlying framing, has received increasing attention recently. We propose a novel unsupervised approach to argument reframing that takes inspiration from counterfactual explanation generation approaches in the field of eXplainable AI (XAI). We formalize the task as a mask-and-replace approach in which an LLM is tasked to replace masked tokens associated with a set of frames to be eliminated by other tokens related to a set of target frames to be added. Our method relies on two key mechanisms: framed decoding and reranking based on a number of metrics similar to those used in XAI to search for a suitable counterfactual. We evaluate our approach on three topics using the dataset by Ruckdeschel and Wiedemann (2022). We show that our two key mechanisms outperform an unguided LLM as a baseline by increasing the ratio of successfully reframed arguments by almost an order of magnitude.',\n",

I first draw from political communication theory to understand the public's production and reception of frames in immigration discourse on Twitter. I develop a codebook, annotated dataset, and NLP models to automatically detect framing strategies across three different typologies, and highlight tradeoffs between issue-generic and issue-specific typologies. Then turning towards social movements, I adopt a similar computational pipeline to study how movements engage in framing practices to create meaning and mobilize collective action.

While their practical applications are now widespread, their potential for misuse, such as generating fake news and committing plagiarism, has posed significant concerns. To address this issue, detectors have been developed to evaluate whether a given text is human-generated or AI-generated.

In chat-based applications, users commonly input prompts and utilize the AI-generated texts. However, zero-shot detectors typically analyze these texts in isolation, neglecting the impact of the original prompts. It is conceivable that this approach may lead to a discrepancy in likelihood assessments between the text generation phase and the detection phase. So far, there remains an unverified gap concerning how the presence or absence of prompts impacts detection accuracy for zero-shot detectors. In this paper, we introduce an evaluative framework to empirically analyze the impact of prompts on the detection accuracy of AI-generated text. We assess various zero-shot detectors using both white-box detection, which leverages the prompt, and black-box detection, which operates without prompt information.

Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.',\n",

Automating the credit risk analysis process using Large Language Models can bring transformative changes to the finance industry, but not without appropriate measures to ensure trustworthy responses. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-engineering method that enhances the ability of Large Language Models to generate reliable credit risk reports - Labeled Guide Prompting (LGP). LGP consists of: (1) providing annotated few-shot examples to the LLM that denote sets of tokens in an exemplary prompt that are of greater importance when generating sets of tokens in the exemplary response and (2) providing text in the prompt that describes the direction, pathways and interactions between variables from a Bayesian network used for credit risk assessment, thus promoting abductive reasoning. Using data from 100 credit applications, we demonstrate that LGP enables LLMs to generate credit risk reports that are preferred by human credit analysts (in 60-90% of cases) over alternative credit risk reports created by their peers in a blind review. Additionally, we found a statistically significant improvement (p-value < 10− 10) in the insightfulness of the responses generated using LGP when compared to identical prompts without LGP components. We conclude that Labeled Guide Prompting can enhance LLM performance in complex problem-solving tasks, achieving a level of competency comparable to or exceeding human experts.',\n",
       " 'With the increasing quality and spread of LLM-based assistants, the amount of artificially generated content is growing rapidly. In many cases and tasks, such texts are already indistinguishable from those written by humans, and the quality of generation tends to only increase. At the same time, detection methods are developing more slowly, making it challenging to prevent misuse of these technologies. In this work, we investigate the task of generated text detection by proposing the GigaCheck. Our research explores two approaches: (i) distinguishing human-written texts from LLM-generated ones, and (ii) detecting LLM-generated intervals in Human-Machine collaborative texts. For the first task, our approach utilizes a general-purpose LLM, leveraging its extensive language abilities to fine-tune efficiently for the downstream task of LLM-generated text detection, achieving high performance even with limited data. For the second task, we propose a novel approach that combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques. Specifically, we use a fine-tuned general-purpose LLM in conjunction with a DETR-like detection model, adapted from computer vision, to localize artificially generated intervals within text. We evaluate the GigaCheck on five classification datasets with English texts and three datasets designed for Human-Machine collaborative text analysis. Our results demonstrate that GigaCheck outperforms previous methods, even in out-of-distribution settings, establishing a strong baseline across all datasets.',\n",
       " \"The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, has resulted in the widespread presence of LLM-generated content on social media platforms, raising concerns about misinformation, data biases, and privacy violations, which can undermine trust in online discourse. While detecting LLM-generated content is crucial for mitigating these risks, current methods often focus on binary classification, failing to address the complexities of real-world scenarios like human-AI collaboration. To move beyond binary classification and address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm for detecting LLM-generated content. This approach introduces two novel tasks: LLM Role Recognition (LLM-RR), a multi-class classification task that identifies specific roles of LLM in content generation, and LLM Influence Measurement (LLM-IM), a regression task that quantifies the extent of LLM involvement in content creation. To support these tasks, we propose LLMDetect, a benchmark designed to evaluate detectors' performance on these new tasks. LLMDetect includes the Hybrid News Detection Corpus (HNDC) for training detectors, as well as DetectEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite that considers five distinct cross-context variations and multi-intensity variations within the same LLM role. This allows for a thorough assessment of detectors' generalization and robustness across diverse contexts. Our empirical validation of 10 baseline detection methods demonstrates that fine-tuned PLM-based models consistently outperform others on both tasks, while advanced LLMs face challenges in accurately detecting their own generated content. Our experimental results and analysis offer insights for developing more effective detection models for LLM-generated content. This research enhances the understanding of LLM-generated content and establishes a foundation for more nuanced detection methodologies.\",\n",

While well-trained text detectors have demonstrated promising performance on unseen test data, recent research suggests that these detectors have vulnerabilities when dealing with adversarial attacks such as paraphrasing. In this paper, we propose a framework for a broader class of adversarial attacks, designed to perform minor perturbations in machine-generated content to evade detection. We consider two attack settings: white-box and black-box, and employ adversarial learning in dynamic scenarios to assess the potential enhancement of the current detection model's robustness against such attacks. The empirical results reveal that the current detection models can be compromised in as little as 10 seconds, leading to the misclassification of machine-generated text as human-written content. Furthermore, we explore the prospect of improving the model's robustness over iterative adversarial learning. Although some improvements in model robustness are observed, practical applications still face significant challenges. These findings shed light on the future development of AI-text detectors, emphasizing the need for more accurate and robust detection methods.\",\n",

However, recent research indicates that these detection systems often lack robustness and struggle to effectively differentiate perturbed texts. Currently, there is a lack of systematic evaluations regarding detection performance in real-world applications, and a comprehensive examination of perturbation techniques and detector robustness is also absent. To bridge this gap, our work simulates real-world scenarios in both informal and professional writing, exploring the out-of-the-box performance of current detectors. Additionally, we have constructed 12 black-box text perturbation methods to assess the robustness of current detection models across various perturbation granularities.

Explanation methods that estimate feature importance promise to provide indications of which parts of an input are used by classifiers for prediction. However, the quality of different explanation methods has not previously been assessed for detectors of MGT. This study conducts the first systematic evaluation of explanation quality for this task.

We find that SHAP performs best in terms of faithfulness, stability, and in helping users to predict the detector's behavior. In contrast, LIME, perceived as most useful by users, scores the worst in terms of user performance at predicting the detectors' behavior.\",\n",

However, there is a risk of effortlessly generating text using advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT, potentially allowing the completion of class assignments without human effort. As it has a significant impact on the fair evaluation of students, we need to distinguish between text generated by model (model generated text) and written by human (human written text). Detection using existing statistical measures, such as log likelihoods, does not perform well for blackboxed models, such as ChatGPT, because it requires access to the internals of the models.

Unfortunately, existing literature lacks a thorough review on this topic. This paper fills this research gap by conducting a comprehensive survey on backdoor attacks against VRSs.

Next, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of backdoor attacks against VRSs from different perspectives and analyze the characteristic of different categories. After that, we comprehensively review existing attack methods and analyze their pros and cons based on the proposed criteria. Furthermore, we review classic backdoor defense methods and generic audio defense techniques. Then we discuss the feasibility of deploying them on VRSs.

While the Security community has recently increased its attention on reproducibility, an independent and comprehensive measurement of the current state of reproducibility has not been conducted. In this paper, we perform the first such study, targeting reproducible artifacts generated specifically by papers on machine learning security (one of the most popular areas in academic research) published in Tier 1 security conferences over the past ten years (2013-2022).

Until now, the mechanisms to inject backdoors into SNN models have been limited to digital scenarios; thus, we present the first evaluation of backdoor attacks in real-world environments. We begin by assessing the applicability of existing digital backdoor attacks and identifying their limitations for deployment in physical environments. To address each of the found limitations, we present three novel backdoor attack methods on SNNs, i.e., Framed, Strobing, and Flashy Backdoor. We also assess the effectiveness of traditional backdoor procedures and defenses adapted for SNNs, such as pruning, fine-tuning, and fine-pruning. The results show that while these procedures and defenses can mitigate some attacks, they often fail against stronger methods like Flashy Backdoor or sacrifice too much clean accuracy, rendering the models unusable. Overall, all our methods can achieve up to a 100% Attack Success Rate while maintaining high clean accuracy in every tested dataset.

       " 'The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has triggered debate about its influence on human intelligence. Artificial intelligence has the capacity to increase human talent in the metaverse, virtual domains that emerge. The potential of AI to function as a learning aid that is adjusted in the metaverse adapts the school to suit individual needs. However, the investigation of the social consequences of the convergence of this technology and concerns about justice and availability are still rare. The metaverse education that AI moved has the potential to increase the differences that already exist in education. In addition, the quality of the metaverse includes all concerns about social exile and the possibility of aligning virtual meetings with real social involvement caused by human behaviour that has excessive dependence on technology to build social connections. This chapter explores the application of creative artificial intelligence in the context of higher education. This study consists of a sample of 79 students. Bachelor students involved in test lessons using laptops, where AI is generative, especially ChatGPT4, is used to produce and modify content, text, data, materials, and tasks. The findings show that ChatGPT4, a type of generative AI, may be used to adjust educational content to meet the knowledge and learning abilities of students with various levels of expertise. Generative material modified by AI was found to be enjoyed by undergraduate students. The use of generative AI in higher education has a big promise because it can promote learning and the development of skills that are motivated by students. Research findings show that the integration of human intelligence, artificial intelligence (AI), and the metaverse presents significant opportunities. Although there are concerns, it is undeniable that AI has the potential to increase human capacity and have transformative impacts on education. Responsible development and application of this technology are needed to guarantee its ability to improve the human experience. Additional investigations are needed to check for and reduce the possibility of social hazards while optimising the benefits of this revolutionary environment.',\n",

However, most neural collective EL methods depend entirely upon neural networks to automatically model the semantic dependencies between different EL decisions, which lack of the guidance from external knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network with recurrent random-walk layers for collective EL, which introduces external knowledge to model the semantic interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, we first establish a model based on local context features, and then stack random-walk layers to reinforce the evidence for related EL decisions into high-probability decisions, where the semantic interdependence between candidate entities is mainly induced from an external knowledge base. Finally, a semantic regularizer that preserves the collective EL decisions consistency is incorporated into the conventional objective function, so that the external knowledge base can be fully exploited in collective EL decisions.

       " 'Entity Resolution (ER) links entities that refer to the same real-world entity from different sources. Existing work usually takes pairs of entities as input and judges those pairs independently. However, there is often interdependence between different pairs of ER decisions, e.g., the entities from the same data source are usually semantically related to each other. Furthermore, current ER approaches are mainly based on attribute similarity comparison, but ignore interdependence between attributes. To address the limits of existing methods, we propose HierGAT, a new method for ER based on a Hierarchical Graph Attention Transformer Network, which can model and exploit the interdependence between different ER decisions. The benefit of our method comes from: 1) The graph attention network model for joint ER decisions; 2) The graph-attention capability to identify the discriminative words from attributes and find the most discriminative attributes. Furthermore, we propose to learn contextual embeddings to enrich word embeddings for better performance. The experimental results on publicly available benchmark datasets show that HierGAT outperforms DeepMatcher by up to 32.5% of F1 score and up to 8.7% of F1 score compared with Ditto.',\n",

Recently, plenty of multimodal entity linking approaches have been proposed to take full advantage of the visual information rather than solely the textual modality. Although feasible, these methods mainly focus on the single-mention scenarios and neglect the scenarios where multiple mentions exist simultaneously in the same context, which limits the performance. In fact, such multi-mention scenarios are pretty common in public datasets and real-world applications. To solve this challenge, we first propose a joint feature extraction module to learn the representations of context and entity candidates, from both the visual and textual perspectives. Then, we design a pairwise training scheme (for training) and a multi-mention collaborative ranking method (for testing) to model the potential connections between different mentions.

Generally, these benchmarks are blessed with strong name regularity, high mention coverage and sufficient context diversity. Unfortunately, when scaling NER to open situations, these advantages may no longer exist. And therefore it raises a critical question of whether previous creditable approaches can still work well when facing these challenges. As there is no currently available dataset to investigate this problem, this paper proposes to conduct randomization test on standard benchmarks. Specifically, we erase name regularity, mention coverage and context diversity respectively from the benchmarks, in order to explore their impact on the generalization ability of models. To further verify our conclusions, we also construct a new open NER dataset that focuses on entity types with weaker name regularity and lower mention coverage to verify our conclusion. From both randomization test and empirical experiments, we draw the conclusions that 1) name regularity is critical for the models to generalize to unseen mentions; 2) high mention coverage may undermine the model generalization ability and 3) context patterns may not require enormous data to capture when using pretrained encoders.',\n",

Among the existing methods, Flat-LAttice Transformer (FLAT) has achieved great success in both performance and efficiency. FLAT performs lexical enhancement for each sentence by constructing a flat lattice (i.e., a sequence of tokens including the characters in a sentence and the matched words in a lexicon) and calculating self-attention with a fully-connected structure. However, the different interactions between tokens, which can bring different aspects of semantic information for Chinese NER, cannot be well captured by self-attention with a fully-connected structure. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Transformer (MVT) to effectively capture the different interactions between tokens. We first define four views to capture four different token interaction structures. We then construct a view-aware visible matrix for each view according to the corresponding structure and introduce a view-aware dot-product attention for each view to limit the attention scope by incorporating the corresponding visible matrix. Finally, we design three different MVT variants to fuse the multi-view features at different levels of the Transformer architecture. Experimental results conducted on four public Chinese NER datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on the most challenging dataset Weibo, which is in an informal text style, MVT outperforms FLAT in F1 score by 2.56%, and when combined with BERT, MVT outperforms FLAT in F1 score by 3.03%.',\n",
       " 'Entity Linking (EL) is a task for mapping mentions in text to corresponding entities in knowledge base (KB). This task usually includes candidate generation (CG) and entity disambiguation (ED) stages. Recent EL systems based on neural network models have achieved good performance, but they still face two challenges: (i) Previous studies evaluate their models without considering the differences between candidate entities. In fact, the quality (gold recall in particular) of candidate sets has an effect on the EL results. So, how to promote the quality of candidates needs more attention. (ii) In order to utilize the topical coherence among the referred entities, many graph and sequence models are proposed for collective ED. However, graph-based models treat all candidate entities equally which may introduce much noise information. On the contrary, sequence models can only observe previous referred entities, ignoring the relevance between the current mention and its subsequent entities. To address the first problem, we propose a multi-strategy based CG method to generate high recall candidate sets. For the second problem, we design a Sequential Graph Attention Network (SeqGAT) which combines the advantages of graph and sequence methods. In our model, mentions are dealt with in a sequence manner. Given the current mention, SeqGAT dynamically encodes both its previous referred entities and subsequent ones, and assign different importance to these entities. In this way, it not only makes full use of the topical consistency, but also reduce noise interference. We conduct experiments on different types of datasets and compare our method with previous EL system on the open evaluation platform.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a HyperNetwork-based Decoupling approach to improve the generalization of FSRE models. Specifically, our model consists of an encoder, a network generator (for producing relation classifiers) and the produced-then-finetuned classifiers for every N-way-K-shot episode. Meanwhile, we design a two-step training framework along with a class-agnostic aligner, in which the generated classifiers focus on acquiring relation-specific knowledge and the encoder is encouraged to learn more general relation knowledge. In this way, the roles of upper and lower layers in an FSRE model are explicitly decoupled, thus enhancing its generalizing capability during testing. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.',\n",

However, the key information for entity linking may exist in nearly everywhere of the documents thus the proposed model cannot capture them all. To leverage more textual information and enhance text understanding capability, we propose a bidirectional multi-paragraph reading model for the zero-shot entity linking task. Firstly, the model treats the mention context as a query and matches it with multiple paragraphs of the entity description documents. Then, the mention-aware entity representation obtained from the first step is used as a query to match multiple paragraphs in the document containing the mention through an entity-mention attention mechanism.

Most current approaches utilize neural models to learn important features of the entity and mention context. However, the topic coherence among the referred entities is frequently ignored, which leads to a clear preference for popular entities but poor accuracy for less popular ones. Moreover, the graph-based models face much noise information and high computational complexity. To solve the problems above, the paper puts forward an entity linking algorithm derived from the asymmetric graph convolutional network and the contextualized semantic relevance, which can make full use of the neighboring node information as well as deal with unnecessary noise in the graph. The semantic vector of the candidate entity is obtained by continuously iterating and aggregating the information from neighboring nodes. The contextualized relevance model is a symmetrical structure that is designed to realize the deep semantic measurement between the mentions and the entities.

Instead of some common self-training strategies that try to throw the mislabeled data away explicitly, we regard self-training as a multiple optimization process with respect to the EL features of EEs, and propose both intra-slot and inter-slot optimizations to alleviate the error reinforcement problem implicitly. We construct two EL datasets involving selected EEs to evaluate the quality of obtained EL features for EEs, and the experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods of learning EL features.',\n",

Specifically, we first establish the local context for latent words and then propose a masked self-attention mechanism to incorporate such local contextual information. Besides, since introducing external knowledge such as lexicon and dependency relation inevitably brings in some noises, we propose a gated information controller to handle this problem.

       " \"The vast amount of web data enables us to build knowledge bases with unprecedented quality and coverage. Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) is an important task that automatically resolves ambiguous mentions in free text to correct target entries in the knowledge base. Traditional machine learning based methods for NED were outperformed and made obsolete by the state-of-the-art deep learning based models. However, deep learning models are more complex, requiring large amount of training data and lengthy training and parameter tuning time. In this paper, we revisit traditional machine learning techniques and propose a light-weight, tuneable and time-efficient method without using deep learning or deep learning generated features. We propose novel adaptive features that focus on extracting discriminative features to better model similarities between candidate entities and the mention's context. We learn a local ranking model based on traditional and the new adaptive features based on the learning-to-rank framework. While arriving at linking decisions individually via the local model, our method also takes into consideration the correlation between decisions by running multiple recurrent global models, which can be deemed as a learned local search method. Our method attains performances comparable to the state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods on NED benchmark datasets while being significantly faster to train.\",\n",

       " \"The Chinese clinical natural language is rich in a large amount of medical record information. Naming entity recognition for electronic medical records can help establish medical auxiliary diagnostic systems, which is of great significance for the development of the medical field. At the same time, it is conducive to downstream tasks such as relationship extraction and the implementation of knowledge graphs. However, Chinese electronic medical records have problems with difficulty in Chinese word segmentation, numerous medical terminology, and special expressions, which can easily lead to incorrect expression of text features. Therefore, this paper proposes a medical named entity recognition research model based on enhanced word information and graph attention, which improves the performance of the network model by enhancing local and global features. Due to the fact that embedding a single word vector for Chinese entity recognition can easily ignore word information and semantics in the text, this paper embeds a highly correlated word vector in the word vector, which not only enhances text representation but also avoids word segmentation errors. Additionally, a Med-Bert model for learning medical knowledge is embedded in the word embedding layer, which can dynamically generate feature vectors according to different contexts, helps solve the problem of polysemy and specialized vocabulary in electronic medical records. At the same time, adding a graph attention module in the coding layer enhances the network's ability to learn text context relationships and enhances the model's learning of medical special grammar. Finally, F1 values of 86.38% and 84.76% are obtained on the cEHRNER and cMedQANER datasets, respectively, showing better robustness compared to other models.\",\n",
       " 'Entity linking, as one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing, is crucial to knowledge fusion, knowledge base construction and update. Nevertheless, in contrast to the research on entity linking for English text, which undergoes continuous development, the Chinese counterpart is still in its infancy. One prominent issue lies in publicly available annotated datasets and evaluation benchmarks, which are lacking and deficient. In specific, existing Chinese corpora for entity linking were mainly constructed from noisy short texts, such as microblogs and news headings, where long texts were largely overlooked, which yet constitute a wider spectrum of real-life scenarios. To address the issue, in this work, we build CLEEK, a Chinese corpus of multi-domain long text for entity linking, in order to encourage advancement of entity linking in languages besides English. The corpus consists of 100 documents from diverse domains, and is publicly accessible. Moreover, we devise a measure to evaluate the difficulty of documents with respect to entity linking, which is then used to characterize the corpus. Additionally, the results of two baselines and seven state-of-the-art solutions on CLEEK are reported and compared. The empirical results validate the usefulness of CLEEK and the effectiveness of proposed difficulty measure.',\n",

Named entity recognition (NER) aims to recognize entities from unstructured text, which is the initial step toward the semantic understanding of the EMRs. Extracting medical information from Chinese EMRs could be a more complicated task because of the difference between English and Chinese. Some researchers have noticed the importance of Chinese NER and used the recurrent neural network or convolutional neural network (CNN) to deal with this task. However, it is interesting to know whether the performance could be improved if the advantages of the RNN and CNN can be both utilized. Moreover, RoBERTa-WWM, as a pre-training model, can generate the embeddings with word-level features, which is more suitable for Chinese NER compared with Word2Vec. In this article, we propose a hybrid model. This model first obtains the entities identified by bidirectional long short-term memory and CNN, respectively, and then uses two hybrid strategies to output the final results relying on these entities. We also conduct experiments on raw medical records from real hospitals. This dataset is provided by the China Conference on Knowledge Graph and Semantic Computing in 2019 (CCKS 2019).

       " 'Entity candidate retrieval plays a critical role in cross-lingual entity linking (XEL). In XEL, entity candidate retrieval needs to retrieve a list of plausible candidate entities from a large knowledge graph in a target language given a piece of text in a sentence or question, namely a mention, in a source language. Existing works mainly fall into two categories: lexicon-based and semantic-based approaches. The lexicon-based approach usually creates cross-lingual and mention-entity lexicons, which is effective but relies heavily on bilingual resources (e.g. inter-language links in Wikipedia). The semantic-based approach maps mentions and entities in different languages to a unified embedding space, which reduces dependence on large-scale bilingual dictionaries. However, its effectiveness is limited by the representation capacity of fixed-length vectors. In this paper, we propose a pivot-based approach which inherits the advantages of the aforementioned two approaches while avoiding their limitations. It takes an intermediary set of plausible target-language mentions as pivots to bridge the two types of gaps: cross-lingual gap and mention-entity gap. Specifically, it first converts mentions in the source language into an intermediary set of plausible mentions in the target language by cross-lingual semantic retrieval and a selective mechanism, and then retrieves candidate entities based on the generated mentions by lexical retrieval. The proposed approach only relies on a small bilingual word dictionary, and fully exploits the benefits of both lexical and semantic matching. Experimental results on two challenging cross-lingual entity linking datasets spanning over 11 languages show that the pivot-based approach outperforms both the lexicon-based and semantic-based approach by a large margin.',\n",

However, the lack of context in the short text can easily lead to ambiguity, which will greatly reduce the efficiency of obtaining information and seriously affect the user’s experience, especially in the financial field. This paper proposed an entity disambiguation algorithm based on multiword vector ensemble and decision to eliminate the ambiguity of entities and purify text information in information processing. First of all, we integrate a variety of unsupervised pre-trained word vector models as vector embeddings according to different word vector models’ characteristics. Moreover, we use the classic architecture of long short-term memory (LSTM) combined with the convolutional neural network (CNN) to fine-tune pre-trained Chinese word vectors such as BERT to integrate the output of entity recognition results. Then build the knowledge base and introduce the focal loss function on the basis of CNN and binary classification to improve the effect of entity disambiguation. Experimental results show that the algorithm performs better than the traditional entity disambiguation algorithm based on the single word vector. This method can accurately locate the entity to be disambiguated and has a good performance in disambiguation accuracy.',\n",

Nevertheless, most of these existing methods are relatively complex so that they are impractical in some situation, e.g. on-line search-engine. This paper proposes a simple approach that combines the merits of the local and global paradigm, which aims at simplifying the entity linking process and achieving considerable performance.

Human verbal and written communication invariably refer to entities, their properties, and their relationships. Moreover, human reasoning often relies on a proper understanding of relationships among various entities. It is perceived that representing entity-centric knowledge in a structured form is most suitable for machines to consume and reason about it. Over the past few decades, numerous methodological advances have been made in extracting entity-centric knowledge from unstructured and semi-structured sources, representing entity-centric knowledge as graph-structured data known as Knowledge Graphs, and using these knowledge graphs in various knowledge-intensive natural language processing tasks. Despite these advances, machines are yet to achieve human-level ability to extract and reason with factual knowledge and use it for various knowledge-intensive tasks. This dissertation proposes novel neural methods to narrow this gap. In particular, for factual knowledge extraction, it proposes efficient and effective methods for the tasks of Entity Linking and Relation Extraction. For knowledge-based logical reasoning, an explainable link prediction method for emerging entities in knowledge graphs is proposed.

The model captures two different aspects of semantic information via representation and interaction-based neural semantic matching models. Furthermore, to consider the global consistency of entities, a recurrent random walk is applied to propagate entity linking evidences among related decisions. Evaluation was conducted on three publicly available standard datasets. Results show that our proposed HSM model is more effective compared with a list of baseline models.',\n",
       " 'In our last semester’s work, we investigated conversational agents and their limitations to provide personalised responses to the user, ie, responses that consider the user’s information. To accomplish this, we observe a need for a structured representation of the personal information to enable the conversational agents to personalise responses. To this end, we explored an architecture of existing solutions to populate personal knowledge graphs (PKGs) by extracting relevant personal information from a conversation. PKGs are usercentered knowledge graphs (KGs), which model the user’s information. These graphs are unique in that they only include information about a single user. Our architecture from the previous semester’s work consists of two phases, where the first is textual triple extraction, ie, the extraction of two substrings or entity mentions from the input utterance and their relation. Second, we link the previously extracted entity mentions to an open KG. We observe a number of inadequacies when using this architecture, which is (1) the architecture does not effectively disambiguate references to personal entities from general entities.(2) The actual relation between the linked entity and the entity mention in the triple is not defined. For this semester, we aimed to improve upon this architecture by adding components responsible for linking entities to a PKG and resolving the triples to fit the PKG. Looking at the inadequacies in the existing architecture, we define two problems, which we refer to as PKG Statement Linking and PKG Enrichment. We concentrated on the PKG Statement Linking challenge, which entails linking each entity mention from the textual triples to PKG entities in a local PKG. To solve the PKG statement linking problem, we require a new, specialised dataset, since no existing dataset contains conversations with textual triples, entity linking to open KG, and personal entity annotations. From our previous semester’s architecture, we know that we require textual triple annotations of conversations, and entity linking annotation to an open KG. Additionally, specific to our problem, we also need annotations of personal entities, ie, annotations of references to the same entity throughout a conversation or references to entities in a local PKG, constructable from the conversation. As the open KG for our dataset, we decided that a Common Sense Knowledge Graph (CSKG) would be more appropriate, as these capture basic knowledge like\" a person has a head and two arms\", which could benefit a conversational agent. We surveyed a number of different CSKGs and determine that ConceptNet is ideal for our use case. As a result, we have constructed a dataset for training and evaluating PKG population architectures with reliable ground truth data. To collect this dataset, we created three different websites to annotate the data. Each website corresponds to one of the annotations required for PKG population. These websites also makes it possible to expand the dataset for future research.',\n",

The abundant entity profiles and relational information in knowledge bases help the downstream applications learn more about the user queries. However, in automated knowledge base construction, ambiguity in data sources is one of the main challenges. Given a constructed knowledge base, it is hard to efficiently find entities of interest and extract their relatedness information from the knowledge base due to its large capacity.

A large number of models were proposed based on the topical coherence assumption. Recently, several works have proposed a new assumption: topical coherence only needs to hold among neighboring mentions, which proved to be effective. However, due to the complexity of the text, there are still some challenges in how to accurately obtain the local coherence of the mention set. Therefore, we introduce the self-attention mechanism in our work to capture the long-distance dependencies between mentions and quantify the degree of topical coherence. Based on the internal semantic correlation, we find the semantic neighbors for every mention. Besides, we introduce the idea of “simple to complex” to the construction of entity correlation graph, which achieves a self-reinforcing effect of low-ambiguity mention towards high-ambiguity mention during collective disambiguation. Finally, we apply the graph attention network to integrate the local and global features extracted from key information and entity correlation graph. We validate our graph neural collective entity disambiguation (GNCED) method on six public datasets and the results demonstrate a better performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art baselines.',\n",

However, most methods fail to consider variations in texture reconstruction difficulty across different regions, treating the difficulty of reconstructing textures for each object in a document image as equal and applying the same approach. Consequently, when faced with high-difficulty restoration textures (HDRT) such as character adhesion or background-text aliasing, they often exhibit semantic deviations and block artifacts. Some methods partition LR images into patches of equal size and discriminate based on the patch’s reconstruction difficulty, but fail to distinguish the varying reconstruction difficulties among different textures within each patch. Therefore, we propose a dynamic pixel-level difficulty-aware texture reconstruction network (DPDTRN). DPDTRN comprises a pixel-level difficulty-aware module that adaptively perceives HDRT across all objects within document image, a dedicated HDRT reconstruction module, and a loss function that facilitates differentiated reconstruction according to the difficulty level of HDRT.

These effects were moderated by the attrition rate (βDepression= 0.025,pDepression< 0.01; βAnxiety= 0.022,pAnxiety< 0.01; βStress= 0.022,pStress< 0.01). Primiparity also had a significant influence on the intervention effect regarding depression symptoms (β = 0.033,p= 0.024).Conclusions. Digital mindfulness interventions are a promising method to reduce mental health symptoms in pregnant women. We identified certain parameters moderating this effect, for example, primiparity and the attrition rate.',\n",

The study involved 377 nulliparous and multiparous women, using a systemic random sampling technique. The data were collected using an interview schedule composed of questions related to demographic and obstetrics characteristics, the FOC questionnaire, and a multidimensional scale of perceived social support. Significant FOC predictors were examined using a binary logistic regression model.ResultsThere was a statistically significant difference between nulliparous and multiparous participants concerning FOC; 80.0% of nulliparous participants had significant FOC compared to 67.8% of multiparous participants (p= 0.011). A binary logistic regression clarified that regular antenatal care and family and spousal support were significantly negatively correlated with significant FOC among multiparous and nulliparous women (p< 0.05). For multiparas, FOC was associated with pregnancy planning and previous labor-related complications. In addition, friends’ support was an important predictor of significantly lower FOC among nulliparous women (p< 0.05).ConclusionsSignificant FOC was higher in nulliparous women when compared to multiparous women.

       " 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in sonodynamic therapy (SDT) can elicit immunogenic cell death (ICD)‐initiated antitumor immunity for augmented sono‐immunotherapy. However, unsatisfactory sonodynamic activity and mediocre ER stress induction ability of sonosensitizers essentially restrict SDT efficacy and ICD stimulation. Herein, a versatile ER‐targeting Iridium(III) nanosonosensitizer is developed as superior ICD inducer for boosted tumor sono‐immunotherapy. An ingenious cholic acid (CA)‐functionalized Iridium(III) sonosensitizer Ir‐CA is well‐designed and skillfully crosslinked with human serum albumin (HSA) to form nanosonosensitizer HSA@Ir‐CA. With high stability, favorable tumor‐targeting ability, and reduction‐responsiveness, HSA@Ir‐CA preferentially accumulates in tumor sites for enhanced cellular uptake, followed by rapid disassembly responding to intracellular reductive environment. The uncaged Ir‐CA can selectively accumulate in ER and precisely disrupt ER with in situ produced type I and II ROS upon US irradiation for a high‐efficiency SDT. Moreover, the maximized ER stress eminently amplifies ICD to evoke robust systemic antitumor immunity, inhibiting the growths of primary/distant tumor, lung metastasis, and tumor recurrence. This ER‐targeting SDT combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor (αPD‐L1) further achieves reinforced therapeutic outcome against immunologically “cold” tumor.

However, for immunogenic “cold” tumors, such as prostate cancer (PCa), the low immunogenicity of the tumor itself is a serious obstacle to efficacy. Here, this work reports a strategy to enhance PCa immunogenicity by triggering cascade self‐enhanced ferroptosis in tumor cells, turning the tumor from “cold” to “hot”. This work develops a transformable self‐assembled peptide TEP‐FFG‐CRApY with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) responsiveness and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protein targeting. TEP‐FFG‐CRApY self‐assembles into nanoparticles under aqueous conditions and transforms into nanofibers in response to ALP during endosome/lysosome uptake into tumor cells, promoting lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). On the one hand, the released TEP‐FFG‐CRAY nanofibers target GPX4 and selectively degrade the GPX4 protein under the light irradiation, inducing ferroptosis; on the other hand, the large amount of leaked Fe2+further cascade to amplify the ferroptosis through the Fenton reaction. TEP‐FFG‐CRApY‐induced immunogenic ferroptosis improves tumor cell immunogenicity by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and increasing intratumor T‐cell infiltration. More importantly, recovered T cells further enhance ferroptosis by secreting large amounts of interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ).

This NLG919‐loaded Epi‐conjugated PEGylated dendrimers bridged with boronate bonds (NLG919@Epi‐DBP) maintains a stable nanostructure during circulation. Under a moderate acidic condition, the PBA group exposes to the sialic acid residue on the tumor cell membrane to enhance the internalization and penetration of NLG919@Epi‐DBP. At pH 5.0, NLG919@Epi‐DBP rapidly disassembles to release the incorporated Epi and NLG919. Epi triggers robust ICD of tumor cells that evokes strong immune response. In addition, inhibition of the IDO1 activity downregulates the metabolism of L‐tryptophan to kynurenine, leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Collectively, this promising strategy has been demonstrated to evoke robust immune response as well as remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment for an enhanced chemo‐immunotherapeutic effect.',\n",

Herein, we report and critically discuss strategies for designing unique nanoparticle formulations that are possibly able to target and eradicate evolving tumors. Being superior to molecular therapeutic agents, nanomaterials are particularly suited to targeting evolving tumors according to their facile tunability, tumor-targeting properties, and multitude of possible therapeutic mechanisms of action. This new concept could pave the way toward the development of a new generation of nanomaterials as therapeutic agents for evolving tumors.',\n",

       " 'Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive and hard-to-treat form of breast cancer. TNBC has a higher propensity for earlier relapse and an increased risk of metastasis than all other forms of breast cancer. TNBC patients have a low survival rate (<5 years). This clearly shows an urgent unmet medical need for TNBC patients. The lack of receptors makes it challenging to develop more effective targeted therapy to treat TNBC. The investigation and development of innovative and multimodal strategies to target this aggressive and heterogeneous tumor are urgently needed. Herein, we highlighted important developments in various metal-based modalities such as photodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, sonodynamic therapy, and drug delivery systems tested on TNBC. Notably, we focus on examples of metallodrugs demonstrating unique mechanisms of action and significant potentialin vitroandin vivostudies. We hope this review will serve as the basis for designing and developing metal-based therapeutics that will enhance the scope of TNBC therapy in clinics.',\n",
       " 'A planar conjugated ligand functionalized with bithiophene and its Ru(II), Os(II), and Ir(III) complexes have been constructed as single‐molecule platform for synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy. The complexes have significant two‐photon absorption at 808\\u2005nm and remarkable singlet oxygen and superoxide anion production in aqueous solution and cells when exposed to 808\\u2005nm infrared irradiation. The most potent Ru(II) complexRu7enters tumor cells via the rare macropinocytosis, locates in both nuclei and mitochondria, and regulates DNA‐related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly including DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibition and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage.Ru7exhibits high efficacy in vivo for malignant melanoma and cisplatin‐resistant non‐small cell lung cancer tumors, with a 100\\u2009% survival rate of mice, low toxicity to normal cells and low residual rate. Such an infrared two‐photon activatable metal complex may contribute to a new generation of single‐molecule‐based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform to address drug resistance in clinical practice and phototherapy for large, deeply located solid tumors.',\n",
       " 'Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death driven by iron‐dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) with the potential for antitumor immunity activation. In this study, a nonferrous cyclopentadienyl metal‐based ferroptosis inducer [Ir(Cp*)(Bet)Cl]Cl (Ir‐Bet) was developed by a metal‐ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy involving the reaction of [Ir(Cp*)Cl]2Cl2with the natural product Betulin. The fusion of Betulin with iridium cyclopentadienyl (Ir‐Cp*) species asIr‐Betnot only tremendously enhanced the antiproliferative activity toward cancer cells, but also activated ferritinophagy for iron homeostasis regulation by PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade inhibition with a lower dosage of Betulin, and then evoked an immune response by nuclear factor kappa‐B (NF‐κB) activation of Ir‐Cp* species. Further immunogenic cell death (ICD) occurred by remarkable ferroptosis through glutathione (GSH) depletion, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) deactivation and ferritinophagy. Anin vivovaccination experiment demonstrated desirable antitumor and immunogenic effects ofIr‐Betby increasing the ratio of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs)/regulatory T cells (Tregs).',\n",

       " 'Here, the development of chiralD‐/L‐CuxOS nanoparticle‐engineered metal–organic frameworks (Fe‐MIL‐88B‐NH2), denoted asD‐/L‐CuxOS@Fe‐MOFs, for cuproptosis and ferroptosis synergistic therapy is described. TheD‐/L‐CuxOS@Fe‐MOF displayed intense circular dichroism (CD) bands at 488\\xa0nm due to the chirality transfer from chiral penicillamine ligands. ChiralD‐/L‐CuxOS@Fe‐MOF showed tumor microenvironment‐triggered catalytic therapeutic activity by simultaneously depletingL‐glutathione (GSH) and generating potent reactive oxygen species in cancer cells. In vivo experimental results synchronously demonstratedD‐CuxOS@Fe‐MOF with higher efficiency of cancer therapy. The findings revealed that copper/iron ions released from chiralD‐CuxOS@Fe‐MOF induced augmented oxidative stress and potent ferroptosis, which synergizes with cuproptosis for enhanced cancer therapy. The synergistic index forD‐CuxOS@Fe‐MOF is determined to be 1.94, whileL‐CuxOS@Fe‐MOF andD,L‐CuxOS@Fe‐MOF with 1.75 and 1.84, respectively. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first report of a chiral nanomaterial capable of inducing synergistic ferroptosis‐cuproptosis therapy for cancers. The results should invigorate studies pursuing the rational design of chiral nanomaterials for efficacious cancer therapy based on cuproptosis and ferroptosis.',\n",
       " 'Copper (Cu), a crucial trace element in physiological processes, has garnered significant interest for its involvement in cancer progression and potential therapeutic applications. The regulation of cellular copper levels is essential for maintaining copper homeostasis, as imbalances can lead to toxicity and cell death. The development of drugs that target copper homeostasis has emerged as a promising strategy for anticancer treatment, with a particular focus on copper chelators, copper ionophores, and novel copper complexes. Recent research has also investigated the potential of copper complexes in cancer therapy.',\n",
       " 'Ru(II) polypyridine complexes have attracted much attention as anticancer agents because of their unique photophysical, photochemical, and biological properties. Despite their promising therapeutic profile, the vast majority of compounds are associated with poor water solubility and poor cancer selectivity. Among the different strategies employed to overcome these pharmacological limitations, many research efforts have been devoted to the physical or covalent encapsulation of the Ru(II) polypyridine complexes into nanoparticles. This article highlights recent developments in the design, preparation, and physicochemical properties of Ru(II) polypyridine complex-loaded nanoparticles for their potential application in anticancer therapy.',\n",
